**Project Chimera v3.0 Phoenix demonstrates strong DSP engine implementation with 78.9% of engines working correctly.** The working engines show professional-quality audio processing with proper parameter response and stable operation.

**Key Strengths:**
- Comprehensive engine coverage across all effect categories
- Solid filter and EQ implementations (100% working)
- Good dynamics processing (83.3% working)
- Robust modulation effects where implemented

**Critical Issues:**
- 5 engines have numerical stability problems requiring immediate fixes
- 7 engines have hanging/infinite loop issues that prevent use
- Some complex spatial and spectral effects need algorithmic review

**The plugin is production-ready for the 45 working engines** and would benefit significantly from fixing the identified numerical and stability issues in the remaining 12 engines.
