## Detailed Test Results

### 1. Frequency Accuracy Analysis

#### Overall Statistics
- **Total Tests:** 45
- **Passed:** 39 (86.7%)
- **Failed:** 6 (13.3%)
- **Average Error:** 3.35 cents
- **Maximum Error:** 24.35 cents

#### Failed Tests (6 total)
All failures occurred at **55 Hz (A1)** - the lowest test frequency:

| Input (Hz) | Shift (st) | Expected (Hz) | Measured (Hz) | Error (cents) | THD (%) |
|------------|------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------|
| 55.00      | -12        | 27.50         | 27.64         | +8.68         | 2.88    |
| 55.00      | -7         | 36.71         | 37.23         | **+24.35**    | 1.53    |
| 55.00      | -5         | 41.20         | 41.75         | **+22.96**    | 1.46    |
| 55.00      | -2         | 49.00         | 49.53         | **+18.59**    | 0.44    |
| 55.00      | +2         | 61.74         | 62.10         | **+10.29**    | 1.46    |
| 110.00     | -12        | 55.00         | 55.29         | +8.97         | 1.63    |

**Pattern:** All failures involve shifting **55 Hz or lower** frequencies. The engine consistently overshoots the target frequency by 8-24 cents. This suggests the algorithm's phase vocoder has difficulty tracking very low frequencies accurately.

#### Passed Tests - Frequency Breakdown

**55 Hz (A1):** 4/9 tests passed (44.4%)
- Failed: -12, -7, -5, -2, +2 semitones
- Passed: 0, +5, +7, +12 semitones

**110 Hz (A2):** 8/9 tests passed (88.9%)
- Failed: -12 semitones only
- Errors: 0.00 to 9.21 cents

**220 Hz (A3):** 9/9 tests passed (100%)
- All shifts within ±4.5 cents
- Excellent performance

**440 Hz (A4):** 9/9 tests passed (100%)
- All shifts within ±2.7 cents
- Outstanding performance

**880 Hz (A5):** 9/9 tests passed (100%)
- All shifts within ±1.1 cents
- Nearly perfect performance

#### Accuracy by Shift Amount

| Shift (st) | Pass Rate | Avg Error | Max Error | Notes |
|------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| -12        | 3/5 (60%) | 4.32      | 8.97      | Downward octave has issues at low freqs |
| -7         | 4/5 (80%) | 7.20      | 24.35     | Worst case scenario |
| -5         | 4/5 (80%) | 6.51      | 22.96     | Poor at 55 Hz |
| -2         | 4/5 (80%) | 4.91      | 18.59     | Poor at 55 Hz |
| 0          | 5/5 (100%)| 0.00      | 0.00      | Perfect passthrough |
| +2         | 4/5 (80%) | 4.30      | 10.29     | Slight overshoot at 55 Hz |
| +5         | 5/5 (100%)| 2.27      | 4.45      | Good |
| +7         | 5/5 (100%)| 0.79      | 1.64      | Excellent |
| +12        | 5/5 (100%)| 0.64      | 1.22      | Excellent |

**Key Insight:** Upward shifts (+5 to +12 semitones) are highly accurate across all frequencies. Downward shifts have issues primarily at 55 Hz and below.

---

### 2. Quality Metrics (THD Analysis)

**Total Harmonic Distortion (THD):**
- **Average:** 0.41%
- **Maximum:** 2.88%
- **Target:** <5%
- **Result:** PASS

The THD results are excellent. Even the worst-case THD (2.88% at 55 Hz, -12 semitones) is well below the 5% threshold and would be imperceptible in most musical applications.

**THD Distribution:**
- 0.00-0.50%: 33 tests (73%)
- 0.50-1.00%: 7 tests (16%)
- 1.00-2.00%: 4 tests (9%)
- 2.00-3.00%: 1 test (2%)

**THD by Frequency:**
- 55 Hz: Avg 0.89%, Max 2.88%
- 110 Hz: Avg 0.57%, Max 1.63%
- 220 Hz: Avg 0.35%, Max 0.64%
- 440 Hz: Avg 0.16%, Max 0.26%
- 880 Hz: Avg 0.10%, Max 0.24%

Higher frequencies produce cleaner output with less distortion.

### 3. Stability Tests

#### 3.1 Long Duration Processing
**Test:** 2 seconds continuous @ 440 Hz, +7 semitones
**Result:** PASS
- No NaN/Inf values detected
- No unexpected silences
- Stable output throughout

#### 3.2 Rapid Parameter Changes
**Test:** Quick shifts between 0, ±12, ±7, ±5, ±2 semitones
**Result:** PASS
- No crashes or artifacts
- Smooth transitions
- No NaN/Inf values

#### 3.3 Edge Cases
**Tests:**
1. DC offset handling: PASS
2. Silence handling: PASS
3. Extreme shifts (±24 semitones): PASS
4. Very low frequency (55 Hz): PASS
5. Very high frequency (8000 Hz): PASS

All edge cases handled without crashes or NaN/Inf values.

### 4. Latency Verification

**Reported Latency:** 7,056 samples (160.00 ms)
**Measured Latency:** ~0 samples (impulse response immediate)
**Result:** PASS (latency < 200ms threshold)

**Note:** The measured latency appears to be 0 due to the test methodology. The reported 160ms is consistent with the algorithm's configuration:
- Block size: 0.16 × sample rate = 7,056 samples
- This is acceptable for real-time processing

---

## Algorithm Analysis

### Implementation Details

The SMBPitchShiftFixed uses the **Signalsmith Stretch** library, which is a high-quality phase vocoder implementation. Key configuration from source code:

```cpp
// From SMBPitchShiftFixed.cpp lines 46-47:
int blockSamples = static_cast<int>(sr * 0.16);    // 7,056 samples @ 44.1kHz
int intervalSamples = static_cast<int>(sr * 0.02); // 882 samples @ 44.1kHz
```

**Overlap Factor:** 7,056 / 882 = 8x overlap
- This is a high-quality setting optimized for low THD
- The comments in the source indicate this was specifically tuned to reduce THD from 8.673% to <0.5%

### Why Low Frequencies Fail

The failures at 55 Hz and below are likely due to:

1. **FFT Resolution Limitation:**
   - Block size: 7,056 samples @ 44.1kHz = 160ms
   - Frequency resolution: 44,100 / 7,056 = 6.25 Hz bins
   - At 55 Hz, you only have 55/6.25 = 8.8 bins representing the fundamental
   - At 27.5 Hz (55 Hz shifted down 1 octave), you only have 4.4 bins
   - This is marginal for accurate phase tracking

2. **Phase Unwrapping Errors:**
   - Phase vocoders track phase changes between frames
   - At very low frequencies, phase changes are small and prone to measurement error
   - The 8x overlap helps but doesn't fully solve this at extreme low frequencies

3. **Cycle Coverage:**
   - At 55 Hz: 160ms block = 8.8 cycles
   - At 27.5 Hz: 160ms block = 4.4 cycles
   - Fewer cycles = less stable pitch estimation

### "Fixed" vs Original

The source code comments (lines 37-42) indicate the "Fixed" version addressed THD issues:
- **Original:** 0.12s blocks, 0.03s interval (4x overlap) → 8.673% THD
- **Fixed:** 0.16s blocks, 0.02s interval (8x overlap) → <0.5% THD

The fix successfully reduced THD but the increased block size (0.12s → 0.16s) may have slightly worsened low-frequency accuracy due to reduced temporal resolution.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Problem: Low-Frequency Pitch Tracking Errors

**Failed Frequencies:**
- 55 Hz and below
- Primarily downward shifts (-12 to -2 semitones)
- Errors ranging from 8.68 to 24.35 cents

**Root Causes:**

1. **Insufficient FFT Resolution**
   - 6.25 Hz bins are too coarse for sub-100 Hz frequencies
   - Need ~2 Hz bins for accurate tracking below 50 Hz
   - Would require 22,050 sample blocks (500ms)

2. **Phase Vocoder Limitations**
   - Phase tracking accuracy degrades at low frequencies
   - Standard phase vocoder limitation, not implementation bug

3. **Block Size Trade-off**
   - Larger blocks: Better frequency resolution, worse time resolution, more latency
   - Current 160ms is already quite large
   - Further increase would impact real-time feel

---

## Recommendations

### For Current Deployment

1. **Add frequency filtering:**
   ```cpp
   // Recommended high-pass filter before processing
   if (fundamentalFreq < 110.0) {
       // Use alternative engine or warn user
   }
   ```

2. **Document limitations clearly:**
   - Note that accuracy degrades below 110 Hz
   - Recommend alternative engines for bass-heavy material

3. **Consider hybrid approach:**
   - Use SMBPitchShiftFixed for mid/high frequencies
   - Use time-domain method for low frequencies
   - Crossover at 100-150 Hz

### For Future Improvements

1. **Increase block size for low frequencies:**
   - Use adaptive block sizing: 500ms blocks for <100 Hz
   - Trade latency for accuracy when needed

2. **Add multi-resolution processing:**
   - Process different frequency bands with different block sizes
   - Similar to how MP3 encoding works

3. **Implement pitch pre-detection:**
   - Use autocorrelation or YIN algorithm to detect input pitch
   - Adjust algorithm parameters based on detected frequency

4. **Consider alternative algorithm for bass:**
   - PSOLA (Pitch Synchronous Overlap-Add) works better for low frequencies
   - Use PSOLA below 150 Hz, phase vocoder above

## Conclusions

### Does SMBPitchShiftFixed Work Correctly?

**Answer: MOSTLY YES, with significant limitations**

The engine performs its core function of pitch shifting, but has accuracy problems at low frequencies (<110 Hz) that exceed acceptable thresholds. This is not a bug but a fundamental limitation of the phase vocoder approach with the current block size settings.

### The "Fixed" Claim

The "Fixed" in the name refers to the THD improvements (8.67% → <0.5%), which this verification confirms are successful. However, the frequency accuracy issues were not addressed (and may have been slightly worsened by the larger block size).

### Final Recommendation

**For production deployment:**

1. **If targeting vocals/mid-range instruments:** ✅ APPROVED
   - Add frequency check: reject if fundamental <110 Hz
   - Document the 160ms latency
   - Quality is excellent in this range

2. **If targeting bass-heavy material:** ❌ NOT APPROVED
   - Use different engine (time-domain methods)
   - Or implement hybrid multi-band approach

3. **For general use:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL
   - Implement runtime frequency detection
   - Route to appropriate engine based on content
   - Use SMBPitchShiftFixed only when suitable
