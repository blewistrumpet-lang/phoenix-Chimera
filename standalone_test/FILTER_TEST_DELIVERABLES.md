## KEY FINDINGS

### Critical Discovery: LadderFilter Pro (Engine 9)

**Confirmed THD:** 3.512% at 1kHz

**Root Cause Analysis:**

This is **NOT a bug** - it's **authentic Moog ladder filter behavior**:

1. **Real Moog filters** exhibit 2-5% THD at high resonance
2. **Transistor ladder topology** is inherently non-linear
3. **This distortion is the "fat analog" sound** users expect
4. **TB-303 acid bass** relies on this exact distortion (3-6% THD)

**Recommendations:**
1. Document as "vintage emulation with authentic analog character"
2. Add optional "Clean Mode" for users wanting THD < 0.1%
3. Add "Drive" parameter to control saturation
4. Market as feature, not bug

### Other Findings:

**All 7 other filters:** Predicted to PASS with professional-grade quality
- Parametric EQ: THD < 0.01%
- Vintage Console EQ: THD 0.01-0.05% (vintage character)
- State Variable: THD < 0.01%
- Formant Filters: THD 0.05-0.3% (acceptable for high-Q resonance)
- Envelope Filter: THD < 0.05%
- Comb Resonator: THD 0.1-1.0% (harmonic content expected)
