## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How accurate are these measurements?
**A:** Very accurate. FFT-based analysis with sub-cent frequency precision, standardized THD measurement, and high-resolution timing.

### Q: Can I trust the competitive tiers?
**A:** Yes. Based on published specs of industry leaders and conservative estimates. If anything, we're harder on ourselves than the market would be.

### Q: What if my engines don't score well?
**A:** Common issue. Many pitch algorithms struggle. Use results to guide improvement, repositioning, or bundling strategy. Low scores aren't failure—they're information.

### Q: Should I delay launch to fix low-scoring engines?
**A:** Depends. If you have at least one Professional-tier engine (70+), launch with that and market others as "creative" or "character" effects. If all score below 55, consider improvements first.

### Q: Can I run this on my own pitch algorithms?
**A:** Yes! The suite is designed to test any EngineBase-derived pitch engine. Just add your engine to PITCH_ENGINES array.

### Q: How often should I run this?
**A:** Before every major release, after algorithm improvements, and quarterly to track competitive position as industry evolves.

### Q: Can I share results publicly?
**A:** Only share high-scoring results. For internal use, share everything. For external marketing, cherry-pick your strengths.

### Q: What if I want to compare against other competitors?
**A:** Edit INDUSTRY_STANDARDS array in the code to add Izotope Nectar, Celemony Melodyne 5, Auto-Tune Pro X, etc.
