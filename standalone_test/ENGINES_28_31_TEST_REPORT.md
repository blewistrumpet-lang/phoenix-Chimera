‚úì SIMD optimization
‚úì No crashes or instabilities

### Leslie 122 Reference Speeds:
| Mode | Horn Speed | Drum Speed | Ratio |

   - Fast mode: param 1.0 ‚Üí 6.7 Hz horn, 1.1 Hz drum

üîß **Priority 2:** Verify speed ratio (horn should be 6-7√ó drum speed)

üîß **Priority 3:** Ensure both horn and drum modulation are audible/detectable

### Current Status:
- **Functional:** Yes, produces rotary speaker effect
- **Authentic:** No, speeds don't match classic Leslie character
- **Production Ready:** Partial - works but needs calibration
- **Musical Use:** Can be used but won't match classic Leslie recordings

## Engine 31: Pitch Shifter

### Overall Result: **NOT TESTED**

Engine 31 (Pitch Shifter) was not included in the modulation engines test suite, as it is classified as a pitch/time manipulation engine rather than a modulation engine. It should be tested with the pitch engines test suite.

**Recommendation:** Test Engine 31 with pitch engines 31-33 test suite.
