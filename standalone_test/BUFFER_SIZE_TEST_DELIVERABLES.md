## Quick Start Guide

### Running the Python Test (Simulation)

```bash
cd /Users/Branden/branden/Project_Chimera_v3.0_Phoenix/standalone_test
python3 test_buffer_size_independence.py
```

**Output**: Report and CSV files in current directory
**Duration**: ~10 seconds
**Status**: ✅ Working

### Running the C++ Test (Actual Engines)

```bash
# Build
cd /Users/Branden/branden/Project_Chimera_v3.0_Phoenix/standalone_test
./build_buffer_size_test.sh

# Run
cd build
./test_buffer_size_independence
```

**Output**: Report and CSV files in build directory
**Duration**: ~5-10 minutes for all engines
**Status**: ⚠️ Ready but requires engine objects compilation
