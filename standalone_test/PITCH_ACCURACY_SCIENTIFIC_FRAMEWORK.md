## 1. Methodology: Multi-Algorithm Consensus Approach

### 1.1 Detection Algorithms Implemented

The framework employs six independent, industry-standard pitch detection algorithms:

#### Algorithm 1: YIN Autocorrelation
- **Type**: Time-domain autocorrelation
- **Strengths**: Highest accuracy for periodic signals, industry standard
- **Implementation**: Full YIN algorithm with parabolic interpolation
- **Use Case**: Primary pitch detector, considered "ground truth"
- **Accuracy**: Sub-sample precision via interpolation

**Technical Details:**
```cpp
1. Calculate difference function: d(τ) = Σ(x[i] - x[i+τ])²
2. Cumulative mean normalization
3. Threshold detection (0.1 threshold)
4. Parabolic interpolation for sub-bin accuracy
5. Return: sample_rate / interpolated_tau
```

#### Algorithm 2: Cepstrum Analysis
- **Type**: Frequency-domain, optimal for harmonic content
- **Strengths**: Robust against noise, excellent for complex tones
- **Implementation**: FFT → log spectrum → inverse FFT
- **Use Case**: Validation for harmonic-rich signals
- **Accuracy**: Quefrency-domain peak detection

**Technical Details:**
```cpp
1. FFT of windowed signal
2. Convert to log spectrum: log(|X(f)|)
3. Inverse FFT to obtain cepstrum
4. Peak detection in quefrency domain
5. Return: sample_rate / peak_quefrency
```

#### Algorithm 3: FFT Peak Detection with Parabolic Interpolation
- **Type**: Frequency-domain spectral analysis
- **Strengths**: Fast, simple, accurate for pure tones
- **Implementation**: Windowed FFT with peak interpolation
- **Use Case**: Fast validation, excellent for sine waves
- **Accuracy**: Sub-bin via 3-point parabolic interpolation

**Technical Details:**
```cpp
1. Apply Hann window
2. Compute 8192-point FFT
3. Find peak magnitude bin
4. 3-point parabolic interpolation:
   p = 0.5 * (α - γ) / (α - 2β + γ)
5. Return: (peak_bin + p) * sample_rate / FFT_size
```

#### Algorithm 4: Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR)
- **Type**: Time-domain, simple but effective
- **Strengths**: Computationally efficient, no FFT required
- **Implementation**: Count sign changes
- **Use Case**: Quick validation, sanity check
- **Accuracy**: Limited by signal purity

**Technical Details:**
```cpp
1. Count zero crossings: sign(x[i]) ≠ sign(x[i-1])
2. Crossings per second = count * sample_rate / N
3. Fundamental = crossings / 2 (full cycle)
4. Return: crossing_rate / 2
```

#### Algorithm 5: Harmonic Product Spectrum (HPS)
- **Type**: Frequency-domain, harmonic analysis
- **Strengths**: Robust fundamental detection, handles harmonics
- **Implementation**: Multiply downsampled spectra
- **Use Case**: Complex tones with strong harmonics
- **Accuracy**: Emphasizes fundamental over harmonics

**Technical Details:**
```cpp
1. Compute FFT spectrum
2. Downsample spectrum by factors 1, 2, 3, 4
3. Multiply: HPS[f] = S[f] * S[2f] * S[3f] * S[4f]
4. Find peak in product
5. Return: peak_frequency
```

#### Algorithm 6: Average Magnitude Difference Function (AMDF)
- **Type**: Time-domain, autocorrelation alternative
- **Strengths**: Computationally efficient, robust
- **Implementation**: Average absolute differences
- **Use Case**: Alternative to YIN, cross-validation
- **Accuracy**: Good for periodic signals

**Technical Details:**
```cpp
1. Calculate: AMDF(τ) = Σ|x[i] - x[i+τ]| / N
2. Find first minimum after initial peak
3. Indicates period length
4. Return: sample_rate / tau_min
```

### 1.2 Consensus Method

**Approach**: Median-based consensus (robust against outliers)

```cpp
1. Run all 6 algorithms independently
2. Collect valid measurements (reject zeros/errors)
3. Calculate median (not mean) for robustness
4. Compute standard deviation
5. Validate: All algorithms must agree within ±50 cents
6. If deviation > 50 cents: Flag as "algorithms disagree"
```

**Rationale**: Median provides robust central tendency, immune to single-algorithm failures or octave errors.

## 2. Test Matrix Design

### 2.1 Engines Under Test (6 Pitch Engines)

| Engine ID | Name | Type | Primary Function |
|-----------|------|------|------------------|
| **31** | Pitch Shifter | Core pitch | Direct pitch manipulation |
| **32** | Detune Doubler | Detuning | Pitch + phase modulation |
| **33** | Intelligent Harmonizer | Harmonic | Musical interval generation |
| **42** | Shimmer Reverb | Effect | Reverb + pitch shifting |
| **49** | Phased Vocoder | Time/Pitch | Phase vocoder implementation |
| **50** | Granular Cloud | Granular | Grain-based pitch shifting |

### 2.2 Test Frequencies (6 Musical Notes)

| Note | Frequency | Musical Context |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| A1 | 55 Hz | Low bass |
| A2 | 110 Hz | Bass guitar |
| A3 | 220 Hz | Male voice |
| A4 | 440 Hz | Concert pitch |
| A5 | 880 Hz | Soprano voice |
| A6 | 1760 Hz | High soprano |

**Rationale**: Covers 6 octaves, spanning musical range from bass to soprano.

### 2.3 Pitch Shifts (9 Semitone Intervals)

| Shift | Interval | Musical Use |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| -12 st | Down octave | Octave down |
| -7 st | Perfect 5th down | Dominant |
| -5 st | Perfect 4th down | Subdominant |
| -2 st | Major 2nd down | Step down |
| 0 st | Unison | Bypass test |
| +2 st | Major 2nd up | Step up |
| +5 st | Perfect 4th up | Subdominant |
| +7 st | Perfect 5th up | Dominant |
| +12 st | Up octave | Octave up |

**Total Tests**: 6 engines × 6 frequencies × 9 shifts = **324 test cases**

---

## 3. Statistical Analysis Framework

### 3.1 Metrics Calculated

For each engine, the following statistics are computed:

#### Primary Metrics:
- **Mean Error**: Average absolute cent error across all valid tests
- **Standard Deviation**: Measure of consistency
- **Min/Max Error**: Best and worst case accuracy
- **95% Confidence Interval**: Statistical reliability bounds
- **Pass Rate**: Percentage of tests within ±5 cent threshold

#### Quality Rating Formula:
```
IF mean < 1¢ AND max < 3¢:    "EXCELLENT (Melodyne-level)"
ELSE IF mean < 3¢ AND max < 5¢: "PROFESSIONAL (Auto-Tune level)"
ELSE IF mean < 5¢ AND max < 10¢: "ACCEPTABLE (Consumer-grade)"
ELSE IF mean < 10¢:             "POOR (Noticeable errors)"
ELSE:                           "FAIL (Unacceptable)"
```

### 3.2 Confidence Intervals (95% CI)

**Formula**: CI = mean ± 1.96 * (σ / √n)

Where:
- mean = average error
- σ = standard deviation
- n = number of valid measurements
- 1.96 = z-score for 95% confidence

**Interpretation**: 95% confident the true mean error lies within this range.

## 4. Professional Standards Comparison

### Industry Benchmarks

| Quality Level | Accuracy | Examples | Our Target |
|---------------|----------|----------|------------|
| **EXCELLENT** | ±1 cent | Melodyne, Celemony Capstan | Tier 1 engines |
| **PROFESSIONAL** | ±3 cents | Auto-Tune, Waves Tune | Tier 2 engines |
| **ACCEPTABLE** | ±5 cents | Consumer DAW plugins | Minimum standard |
| **POOR** | ±10 cents | Free/amateur tools | Below threshold |
| **FAIL** | >±10 cents | Broken/unusable | Unacceptable |

### 4.1 What is a "Cent"?

**Definition**: 1 cent = 1/100th of a semitone

**Musical Context**:
- **0-3 cents**: Imperceptible to most listeners
- **5 cents**: Trained ear may notice
- **10 cents**: Clearly audible pitch error
- **20 cents**: Obvious detuning
- **100 cents**: Full semitone (wrong note)

**Formula**: cents = 1200 * log₂(f_measured / f_expected)

---

## 7. Validation Criteria

### 7.1 Per-Test Pass/Fail

Based on mean error and worst-case (max) error:

| Mean Error | Max Error | Rating |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| < 1¢ | < 3¢ | EXCELLENT |
| < 3¢ | < 5¢ | PROFESSIONAL |
| < 5¢ | < 10¢ | ACCEPTABLE |
| < 10¢ | any | POOR |
| ≥ 10¢ | any | FAIL |

### 7.3 Overall System Pass/Fail

**PASS**: Overall pass rate ≥ 70%
**FAIL**: Overall pass rate < 70%

**Rationale**: At least 70% of all 324 tests must meet the ±5 cent standard.
