# Engine 49 (PhasedVocoder) - Quick Status

## ✅ VERIFIED - FULLY OPERATIONAL

**Date:** October 11, 2025
**Time Spent:** 1 hour

---

## TL;DR

**Engine 49 is WORKING CORRECTLY.** The warmup fix has been verified and the engine is production-ready.

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Warmup Fix Status: ✅ CONFIRMED

**Location:** `/Users/Branden/branden/Project_Chimera_v3.0_Phoenix/JUCE_Plugin/Source/PhasedVocoder.cpp`

- **Line 341:** `statePtr->warmupSamples = statePtr->latency;` ✅
- **Line 392:** `state.warmupSamples = state.latency;` ✅

**Result:**
- **Before:** 4096 samples (93ms @ 44.1kHz) - appeared broken
- **After:** 2048 samples (46ms @ 44.1kHz) - normal operation

### 2. Latency: ✅ CORRECT

- **Measured:** ~2048 samples (46.4ms @ 44.1kHz)
- **Expected:** ~46ms for FFT_SIZE=2048 phase vocoder
- **Status:** Within specification

### 3. Audio Processing: ✅ FUNCTIONAL

- Impulse response: ✅ Output detected
- 1kHz sine wave: ✅ Clean output
- Pitch shifting: ✅ Working (+12/-12 semitones verified)
- Time stretching: ✅ Working

### 4. Duplicate Check: ✅ NOT A DUPLICATE

**Engine 31 (PitchShifter):** Creative vocal effect with 3 modes
**Engine 49 (PhasedVocoder):** Precision spectral processor

They are **completely different** engines serving different purposes.

## What Was Fixed

The warmup period was reduced from:
```cpp
// OLD (incorrect):
warmupSamples = latency + FFT_SIZE;  // 2048 + 2048 = 4096 samples

// NEW (correct):
warmupSamples = latency;  // 2048 samples
```

This made the engine appear functional in tests and real-time use.

## For Testing

**Minimum buffer size:** 4096 samples (to hear output after warmup)

**Neutral parameters:**
```cpp
params[0] = 0.2f;   // TimeStretch = 1.0x (neutral)
params[1] = 0.5f;   // PitchShift = 0 semitones (neutral)
params[6] = 1.0f;   // Mix = 100% wet
```

**Test signals:**
- Impulse (for latency measurement)
- 1kHz sine wave (for pitch shift verification)
- Speech (for quality testing)

## Recommendations

1. ✅ **Use in Production** - Engine is ready
2. ✅ **Document Warmup** - First 46ms is silent (expected behavior)
3. ✅ **Parameter Guide** - Ensure UI shows correct parameter mapping
