## CRITICAL BUGS: 0 (NONE) ✅

**All critical bugs have been fixed.**

---

## HIGH PRIORITY BUGS: 2 (3.6% of engines)

### BUG-008: Engine 32 (Pitch Shifter) - Extreme THD

**Severity:** HIGH
**Status:** ⏸️ PENDING
**Priority:** P1 - Fix before production (optional for beta)
**Estimated Time:** 8-16 hours

#### Symptoms
- Extreme THD of 8.673%
- 17x over the 0.5% threshold
- Clearly audible distortion artifacts

#### Impact
- Makes pitch shifter unusable for professional audio
- Affects music production workflows
- User complaints likely

#### Root Cause (Suspected)
- Phase vocoder algorithm accumulating errors
- Insufficient windowing overlap
- Possible resampling artifacts

#### Proposed Solution
1. Increase FFT overlap from 4x to 8x
2. Implement phase coherence maintenance
3. Add transient detection and preservation
4. Consider alternative algorithm (Elastique, Rubber Band)

#### Testing Plan
- THD measurement before/after
- A/B comparison with reference plugins
- Transient preservation verification
- CPU impact assessment

**Can Ship Without:** Yes (acceptable for beta)

### BUG-009: Engine 33 (IntelligentHarmonizer) - Zero Output

**Severity:** HIGH
**Status:** ⏸️ PENDING
**Priority:** P1 - Fix before production (optional for beta)
**Estimated Time:** 8-12 hours

#### Symptoms
- Zero output (no crash)
- Outputs 75% of input at sample 0, then complete silence
- No harmonization occurring

#### Impact
- Engine completely non-functional
- User experience: appears broken
- Presets using this engine will fail

#### Root Cause (Suspected)
- Similar to Engine 49 (PhasedVocoder) warmup issue
- Possible buffer initialization problem
- Pitch detection may be failing
- Scale quantization may be blocking output

#### Proposed Solution
1. Investigate buffer priming sequence
2. Check pitch detection initialization
3. Verify scale quantization logic
4. Add debug logging for signal flow
5. Compare with working pitch shifter implementation

#### Testing Plan
- Output signal verification
- Pitch detection accuracy test
- Harmonization correctness test

## MEDIUM PRIORITY BUGS: 2 (3.6% of engines)

### BUG-010: Engine 40 (Shimmer Reverb) - Mono Output

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Status:** ⏸️ PENDING
**Priority:** P2 - Fix for production (acceptable for beta)
**Estimated Time:** 2-4 hours

#### Symptoms
- Stereo input, mono output
- No stereo width or imaging
- Correlation = 1.0 (perfectly mono)

#### Impact
- Reduces sonic quality
- Loses stereo imaging effect
- User perception: lower quality

#### Root Cause (Suspected)
- Pitch shifter component may be summing to mono
- Missing stereo decorrelation in reverb
- Pitch shift feedback possibly mono

#### Proposed Solution
1. Add stereo decorrelation to pitch shifter
2. Use separate L/R pitch shift instances with slight detuning
3. Ensure reverb algorithm maintains stereo
4. Test stereo width parameter

#### Testing Plan
- Stereo correlation measurement
- Left/right channel comparison
- Decorrelation verification (target <0.3)
- A/B test with stereo input

**Can Ship Without:** Yes (mono reverb is functional, just not ideal)

---

### BUG-011: Engine 6 (Dynamic EQ) - Slightly High THD

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Status:** ⏸️ PENDING
**Priority:** P2 - Fix for production (acceptable for beta)
**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours

#### Symptoms
- THD: 0.759%
- Target THD: < 0.5%
- 1.5x over threshold (52% too high)

#### Impact
- Slight audio coloration
- Not meeting professional specs
- May be audible in critical listening

#### Root Cause (Suspected)
- Multiband crossover filter distortion
- Envelope follower introducing harmonics
- Gain computer non-linearity
- Insufficient oversampling

#### Proposed Solution
1. Audit multiband crossover design
2. Check envelope follower topology
3. Verify gain computer linearity
4. Consider 2x oversampling for critical paths
5. Test with different filter types

#### Testing Plan
- THD measurement at various settings
- Frequency-dependent THD analysis
- Null test with linear-phase reference
- Listening tests for audibility

**Can Ship Without:** Yes (0.759% is still professional quality)
