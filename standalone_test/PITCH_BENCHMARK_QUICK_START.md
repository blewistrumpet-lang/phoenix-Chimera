Engine 33: Professional (72/100) → Market as premium, $149
Engine 32: Mid-tier (68/100)     → Value option, $79
Engine 49: Mid-tier (61/100)     → Value option, $79
Engine 34: Creative (52/100)     → Character FX, $49
Engine 36: Creative (48/100)     → Character FX, $49
Engine 37: Creative (45/100)     → Character FX, $49
Engine 50: Mid-tier (58/100)     → Creative tool, $79

STRATEGY:
- Lead with Engines 31 & 33 (professional tier)
- Bundle 32, 49, 50 as "Pro Bundle" at $199
- Bundle 34, 36, 37 as "Vintage Bundle" at $99
- "Complete Pitch Collection" for $349
```

### Example 2: Clear Winner
```
Engine 31: Best-in-class (87/100)  → FLAGSHIP, $299
Engine 33: Professional (74/100)   → Premium, $149
Engine 32: Professional (71/100)   → Premium, $149
All others: Mid-tier or below      → Budget options

STRATEGY:
- Lead with Engine 31: "Melodyne alternative"
- Premium tier: Engines 31, 33, 32 at $499 bundle
- Market Engine 31 individually at $299
- Use other engines for upsell and bundles
```

### Example 3: All Mid-tier
```
All engines: 55-69 range

STRATEGY:
- Position as "budget professional"
- Aggressive pricing: $49-79 per engine
- "Complete Collection" at $199
- Compete on value, not premium quality
- Target home studios and education
```

## Red Flags

### Critical Issues (Stop & Fix)
- ❌ Pitch accuracy >10 cents → Algorithm broken
- ❌ THD >5% → Serious quality problems
- ❌ Latency >200ms → Unusable
- ❌ CPU >20% → Performance disaster

### Concerning (Needs Attention)
- ⚠️ Pitch accuracy 5-10 cents → Below professional standard
- ⚠️ THD 2-5% → Quality issues
- ⚠️ Latency 100-200ms → Usability problems
- ⚠️ CPU 10-20% → Limited scalability

## What If Results Are Bad?

### Don't Panic - You Have Options

#### Option 1: Reposition
- Market as "creative" or "character" effects
- Emphasize unique sound over clinical accuracy
- Price accordingly ($29-49)

#### Option 2: Bundle Only
- Don't sell individually
- Include in larger effect collections
- Treat as "bonus" effects

#### Option 3: Improve & Re-test
- Identify specific weak metrics
- Algorithm improvements
- Re-run benchmark after updates
- Track improvement over time

#### Option 4: Replace Algorithm
- License professional algorithm (Elastique, etc.)
- Significant cost but guaranteed quality
- Re-run benchmark with new algorithm
- Price to cover licensing costs

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How accurate are these measurements?
**Very accurate.** FFT-based analysis with sub-cent precision. Same methodology used in professional audio analysis tools.

### Can I trust the competitive tiers?
**Yes.** Based on objective measurements against published specs of industry leaders. Conservative estimates.

### What if my engines don't score well?
**Common issue.** Many pitch algorithms struggle. Use results to guide improvement or repositioning.

### Should I fix low-scoring engines?
**Depends on ROI.** If you can improve to Professional tier (70+), worth the investment. If stuck below 55, consider alternatives.

### Can I run this multiple times?
**Yes.** Run after algorithm improvements to track progress. Results are deterministic.

### How long until I can market based on these results?
**Immediately for high scorers (70+).** For lower scorers, fix first or reposition marketing.
