## Recommendations

1. **User Request Clarification**:
   - User requested "TapeSaturation, VinylDistortion, HarmonicExciter_Platinum"
   - These engines don't exist as 21-23
   - HarmonicExciter_Platinum is Engine 17
   - Consider testing Engine 17 if harmonic exciter is needed
   - Consider creating TapeSaturation and VinylDistortion engines if desired

2. **Engine 23 Categorization**:
   - StereoChorus (23) is categorized under "MODULATION" not "DISTORTION"
   - The distortion engine range ends at 22 in the codebase
   - This is correct per the engine factory mapping

3. **All Engines Pass**:
   - All three engines implement proper signal flow
   - All have appropriate output level protection
   - All use stable DSP algorithms
   - All are production-ready

4. **Quality Observations**:
   - Engine 21: Exceptional analog modeling quality
   - Engine 22: Excellent stable overdrive design
   - Engine 23: Solid modulation implementation

## Conclusion

All three engines (21-23) pass testing requirements:
- ✓ Impulse response tests pass
- ✓ Distortion characteristics are appropriate for each type
- ✓ Output levels are well-controlled and safe
- ✓ Code quality is professional-grade
- ✓ No crashes, hangs, or undefined behavior detected

**However**, note the discrepancy between user request and actual engine IDs:
- User expected distortion engines for all three
- Engine 23 is actually a modulation effect (chorus)
- Requested engines (TapeSaturation, VinylDistortion) don't exist in this ID range

**Final Verdict**: All engines PASS technical requirements, but clarification needed on engine identification and user expectations.
