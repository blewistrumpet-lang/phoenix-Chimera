SMBPitchShiftFixed (Engine 34) - QUICK REFERENCE CARD
================================================================================

VERDICT: ⚠️ CONDITIONAL PASS - Use only for mid/high-frequency content

================================================================================
AT A GLANCE
================================================================================

Pass Rate:        39/45 tests (86.7%)
Avg Error:        3.35 cents (excellent)
Max Error:        24.35 cents (exceeds ±5 cent target)
Avg THD:          0.41% (excellent)
Max THD:          2.88% (well under 5% target)
Latency:          160ms (acceptable for studio, marginal for live)
Stability:        Perfect (no crashes, no NaN/Inf)

================================================================================
USE THIS ENGINE FOR:
================================================================================

✅ Vocals (male/female) - fundamental 80-1000 Hz
✅ Piano, guitar, brass, woodwinds - mid-range content
✅ Any content with fundamental >220 Hz
✅ Upward pitch shifts (+5 to +12 semitones) - 100% pass rate
✅ Studio/post-production work (latency OK)

Expected performance: ±4.5 cents accuracy, <1% THD

================================================================================
DO NOT USE THIS ENGINE FOR:
================================================================================

❌ Bass guitar (low E = 41 Hz, A = 55 Hz)
❌ Kick drums, sub-bass, bass synths
❌ Downward transposition of already-low content
❌ Any content with fundamental <110 Hz
❌ Real-time live performance requiring <50ms latency

Failures: Up to 24 cents error at 55 Hz with downward shifts

================================================================================
FAILED TESTS (6 total)
================================================================================

All at 55 Hz or shifting down to 55 Hz:

55 Hz → 27.5 Hz  (-12 st):  +8.68 cents   [Marginal]
55 Hz → 36.7 Hz   (-7 st): +24.35 cents   [WORST - avoid!]
55 Hz → 41.2 Hz   (-5 st): +22.96 cents   [Very poor]
55 Hz → 49.0 Hz   (-2 st): +18.59 cents   [Poor]
55 Hz → 61.7 Hz   (+2 st): +10.29 cents   [Marginal]
110 Hz → 55.0 Hz (-12 st):  +8.97 cents   [Marginal]

================================================================================
FREQUENCY PERFORMANCE BREAKDOWN
================================================================================

 55 Hz (A1):  44% pass rate  ⚠️  POOR
110 Hz (A2):  89% pass rate  ⚠️  CAUTION
220 Hz (A3): 100% pass rate  ✅  EXCELLENT
440 Hz (A4): 100% pass rate  ✅  EXCELLENT
880 Hz (A5): 100% pass rate  ✅  EXCELLENT

Safe frequency range: >110 Hz (ideally >220 Hz)

================================================================================
SHIFT DIRECTION PERFORMANCE
================================================================================

Upward   (+5 to +12 st):  100% pass rate  ✅  Use freely
Neutral  (0 st):          100% pass rate  ✅  Perfect
Downward (-12 to -2 st):   76% pass rate  ⚠️  Check input frequency!

================================================================================
WHY IT FAILS AT LOW FREQUENCIES
================================================================================

Root Cause: FFT resolution insufficient for <100 Hz pitch tracking

Technical:
- FFT bin size: 6.25 Hz
- At 55 Hz: only 8.8 bins per cycle (need 10+ for accuracy)
- At 27.5 Hz: only 4.4 bins per cycle (marginal)

This is NOT a bug - it's a fundamental phase vocoder limitation.
The "Fixed" version optimized for THD (8x overlap) which uses
larger blocks, trading some frequency resolution for quality.

================================================================================
ALGORITHM DETAILS
================================================================================

Name:         Signalsmith Stretch (phase vocoder)
Block Size:   7,056 samples (160ms @ 44.1kHz)
Interval:     882 samples (20ms)
Overlap:      8x (optimized for low THD)
FFT Bins:     6.25 Hz resolution
Latency:      160ms

Trade-offs:
  ✅ Excellent THD (<0.5% typical)
  ❌ High latency (160ms)
  ✅ Very stable
  ❌ Poor low-frequency accuracy

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DEPLOYMENT
================================================================================

1. Add frequency detection:
   - Measure fundamental frequency of input
   - If <110 Hz, use different engine or warn user

2. Document limitations:
   - "Optimized for vocals and mid-range instruments"
   - "Not recommended for bass-heavy content"

3. Consider high-pass filter:
   - Optional HPF at 110 Hz before processing
   - Prevents problematic low-frequency content

4. UI suggestions:
   - Label as "High Quality (Vocals/Mid-Range)"
   - Show warning icon if input too low

================================================================================
ALTERNATIVE ENGINES
================================================================================

For bass/low-frequency content:
  → Use PSOLA or time-domain method
  → Better accuracy below 100 Hz

For low latency (<50ms):
  → Use resampling-based method
  → Lower quality but minimal latency

For extreme quality:
  → Use spectral reassignment
  → Higher CPU but best accuracy

For general use:
  → Implement frequency-based routing
  → Use SMB for >110 Hz, alternative for <110 Hz

FINAL ANSWER TO "DOES IT WORK?"
================================================================================

YES - For mid/high-frequency content (>110 Hz)
  ✅ Excellent accuracy (±4.5 cents)
  ✅ Excellent quality (<1% THD)
  ✅ Very stable, no artifacts
  ✅ Production-ready for vocals, guitars, pianos, brass, etc.

NO - For low-frequency content (<110 Hz)
  ❌ Poor accuracy (up to 24 cents error)
  ❌ Fails 6/9 tests at 55 Hz
  ❌ Not production-ready for bass
  ❌ Requires alternative engine

OVERALL: Conditional approval - excellent engine when used correctly!
