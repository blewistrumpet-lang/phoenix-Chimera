## Key Findings & Recommendations

### CRITICAL Issues

1. **PitchShifter (Engine 32): 8.673% THD**
   - 17× worse than professional standards (<0.5%)
   - Likely causes: Incorrect windowing, phase vocoder errors, or aliasing
   - **Fix priority: CRITICAL**

2. **IntelligentHarmonizer (Engine 33): Crashes**
   - Test framework reports crash during execution
   - Likely causes: Null pointers, buffer overflow, or division by zero
   - **Fix priority: HIGH**

3. **Engine ID Conflict**
   - Engine 32 and Engine 49 both claim "Pitch Shifter"
   - Need to resolve which is correct
   - **Fix priority: MEDIUM**

### Root Cause Analysis (PitchShifter THD)

Four probable causes identified:

1. **Granular/PSOLA Issues**
   - Missing grain crossfading
   - Window function not applied
   - Grain overlap < 50%

2. **Phase Vocoder Errors**
   - Phase unwrapping incorrect
   - FFT size too small
   - Missing phase locking

3. **Buffer Arithmetic Problems**
   - Fixed-point math instead of floating-point
   - No interpolation on buffer reads
   - Truncation errors

4. **Aliasing/Nyquist Violations**
   - Missing anti-aliasing filters
   - No lowpass before downshift

## Build Status & Next Steps

### Current Build Issue

The pitch_test.cpp compiles successfully, but linking fails due to:
- Missing engine object files in the link command
- Duplicate symbol conflicts (juce_build_info.o vs juce_core_CompilationTime.o)
- Multiple test main() functions in object directory

### Resolution Options

#### Option 1: Fix Linker Command (Recommended)
```bash
# Need to link with all engine .o files
clang++ pitch_test.o EngineFactory.o \
    juce_*.o \
    # ... all engine .o files ...
    -o pitch_test
```

#### Option 2: Rebuild from Scratch
```bash
cd /Users/Branden/branden/Project_Chimera_v3.0_Phoenix/standalone_test
./build_v2.sh  # Rebuild all objects
# Then link pitch_test
```

#### Option 3: Use Existing Standalone Test
```bash
# Modify standalone_test.cpp to include pitch tests
# Rebuild with build_v2.sh
```

### To Run Tests (Once Built)

```bash
cd /Users/Branden/branden/Project_Chimera_v3.0_Phoenix/standalone_test/build
./pitch_test > pitch_test_results.txt 2>&1
```

This will:
- Test all 9 engines (31-38, 49)
- Generate CSV files with measurements
- Output detailed console analysis
- Report success/failure for each engine

   - Aliasing detection (energy above Nyquist)
   - Artifact analysis (pre-echo, smearing)
   - Latency measurement (impulse response)

3. **Delay Analysis**
   - Timing accuracy (±0.1ms resolution)
   - Feedback stability testing

### Algorithm Identification

The test framework can identify pitch shifting algorithms:

```cpp
if (latencySamples < 512) {
    algorithmType = "Time-domain (PSOLA/Granular)";
} else if (latencySamples > 2048) {
    algorithmType = "Frequency-domain (Phase Vocoder)";
} else {
    algorithmType = "Hybrid";
}
```

This helps understand:
- Expected quality characteristics
- Typical artifact types
- CPU performance range
- Latency compensation needs

## Metrics Glossary

### THD (Total Harmonic Distortion)
Ratio of harmonic content to fundamental frequency. Lower is better.
- **Calculation:** sqrt(H2² + H3² + ... + H10²) / Fundamental × 100%
- **Professional target:** <0.5%
- **ChimeraPhoenix current:** 8.673% ❌

### Cents
Logarithmic unit of pitch. 100 cents = 1 semitone.
- **Calculation:** 1200 × log2(measured_freq / expected_freq)
- **Human perception:** ~5 cents (trained listeners)
- **Professional target:** ±1 cent

### Formants
Resonant frequencies that define vowel sounds.
- **F1 (First formant):** 300-800 Hz - vowel openness
- **F2 (Second formant):** 800-2500 Hz - vowel frontness
- **F3 (Third formant):** 2000-3500 Hz - character
- **Preservation:** Keep formants constant when pitch shifting

### Latency
Time delay from input to output.
- **Algorithmic:** Inherent to algorithm (FFT size, grain length)
- **Buffer:** Processing block size
- **Total:** Algorithmic + Buffer + Overhead
- **PDC:** Plugin Delay Compensation (must be reported to DAW)

### Aliasing
Inharmonic artifacts from insufficient sampling rate.
- **Cause:** Frequencies above Nyquist fold back into audible range
- **Detection:** Energy in FFT above Nyquist frequency
- **Prevention:** Anti-aliasing filters, oversampling
