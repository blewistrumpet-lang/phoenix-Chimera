# PITCH ENGINE AUDIO QUALITY ANALYSIS - INDEX
## Complete Documentation and Test Suite

**Generated:** October 11, 2025
**Mission:** Prove pitch engines deliver professional audio quality
**Status:** Analysis Complete - Critical Issues Identified

---

## EXECUTIVE BRIEFING

### Quick Status

- **Engines Tested:** 8
- **Tests Performed:** 224
- **Engines Meeting Professional Standards:** **0 (0%)**
- **Overall Status:** **CRITICAL - NOT PRODUCTION READY**

### Key Finding

All 8 pitch engines **fail to meet professional audio quality standards**, primarily due to:
1. Excessive THD+N (hundreds of thousands of percent)
2. Poor SNR (negative to low positive dB)
3. Formant preservation issues

**However:** The extremely high THD+N values may indicate measurement methodology issues rather than actual catastrophic failures. Some metrics (transient preservation) are excellent, suggesting targeted fixes may be sufficient.

## KEY INSIGHTS

### What's Working Well ✓

1. **Transient Preservation**: 6/8 engines excellent (< 0.25 ms)
2. **Formant Preservation**: Engine 33 perfect (0 Hz shift)
3. **Artifact Detection**: Generally low across all engines
4. **Algorithm Stability**: No crashes or NaN/Inf values

### Critical Issues ✗

1. **THD+N**: Catastrophically high (435x to 3,000,000x threshold)
2. **SNR**: Far below professional threshold (47-117 dB worse)
3. **Production Readiness**: 0/8 engines meet standards

### Important Caveat ⚠️

The extremely high THD+N values (>1,000,000%) are **physically unrealistic** and suggest:

1. **Measurement methodology issues**
   - Delay engines may not be pitch-shifting
   - FFT analysis may be measuring echoes as "noise"
   - Wet/dry mix may not be 100% wet

2. **Engine classification issues**
   - Some engines may be delay/echo, not pitch shifters
   - Parameters may not be correctly mapped

3. **Contradictory evidence**
   - Transient preservation is excellent
   - Artifact counts are acceptable
   - Some metrics are production-quality

**Recommendation:** Validate test methodology before concluding engines are catastrophically broken.

---

## ACTION PLAN

### Phase 1: Validation (1-2 Days)

**Priority:** IMMEDIATE

1. ✓ Review test methodology
2. ✓ Verify engine configuration
3. ✓ Confirm wet/dry mix settings
4. ✓ Validate parameter mappings
5. ✓ Cross-check with alternative measurement tools

### Phase 2: Analysis (2-3 Days)

**Priority:** HIGH

1. Root cause analysis for THD+N issues
2. Identify common problems across engines
3. Separate pitch shifters from delay engines
4. Prioritize fixes by severity

### Phase 3: Implementation (1-2 Weeks)

**Priority:** MEDIUM

1. Fix critical THD+N and SNR issues
2. Optimize signal path and gain staging
3. Implement professional-grade algorithms
4. Focus on Engine 33 (best performer)

### Phase 4: Validation (1 Week)

**Priority:** MEDIUM

1. Re-test with validated methodology
2. A/B test against industry standards
3. Conduct user acceptance testing
4. Generate production release report

**Estimated Timeline to Production:** 3-4 weeks (assuming issues are real)

## DEPLOYMENT RECOMMENDATION

### Current Status: **NOT PRODUCTION READY**

**Risk Level:** **HIGH**

**Rationale:**
- 0/8 engines meet professional audio quality standards
- Critical THD+N and SNR issues
- Potential for user complaints and reputational damage

### Conditions for Production Release

1. **Minimum Requirements:**
   - THD+N < 10% (relaxed threshold)
   - SNR > 70 dB (relaxed threshold)
   - No critical artifacts
   - At least 3/8 engines meeting standards

2. **Professional Release:**
   - THD+N < 5%
   - SNR > 80 dB
   - Transient smearing < 5 ms
   - Formant preservation < 50 Hz
   - At least 6/8 engines meeting standards

### Current Gap to Production

- **THD+N:** 435x to 3,000,000x worse than target
- **SNR:** 47 to 117 dB worse than target
- **Ready Engines:** 0 out of 8

### Adding New Metrics

1. Add metric calculation function (e.g., `measureNewMetric()`)
2. Add result field to `ComprehensiveQualityReport` struct
3. Call metric function in `runComprehensiveQualityTest()`
