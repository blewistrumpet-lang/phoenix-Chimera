- Hop Size: 256 samples (75% overlap)
- Window: Generated in prepareWindow()
- Bins: 513 (kFFTSize / 2 + 1)

**Key Features:**

```
Proper latency compensation implemented.

### FFT Artifact Analysis

**Time Smearing:**
- Hop size 256 @ 48kHz = 5.33ms between frames
- Good time resolution for gating
- 75% overlap maintains smoothness

**Frequency Resolution:**
- FFT size 1024 @ 48kHz = 46.9Hz per bin

### Grading

| Criterion | Grade | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|

| **Bug Fix** | N/A | No recent bug fixes reported |

**Overall Grade: A-**

**Strengths:**
- Platinum rewrite ensures stability
- Effective noise reduction
- Per-bin processing with frequency-selective gating
- Proper latency reporting

## ENGINE 49: PhasedVocoder (Robotizer)

### Architecture Analysis

**FFT Configuration:**
- FFT Size: 4096 samples (FFT_ORDER = 12)
- Hop Size: Variable (depends on time stretch)
- Large FFT for good frequency resolution
- Phase vocoder algorithm for pitch/time manipulation

**Key Features:**
- Time stretch (0.25x - 4x range typical)
- Pitch shift (-24 to +24 semitones typical)
- Spectral smear
- Transient preserve with attack/release
- Phase reset for robotizer effect
- Spectral gate
- Freeze capability

**Parameters (10 total):**
0. TimeStretch
1. PitchShift
2. SpectralSmear
3. TransientPreserve
4. PhaseReset (robotizer!)
5. SpectralGate
6. Mix
7. Freeze
8. TransientAttack
9. TransientRelease

**Robotizer Effect:**
The phase reset parameter (ParamID 4) creates the classic robotizer/vocoder sound by resetting phase relationships, removing natural phase modulation from vocal sources.

### FFT Artifact Analysis

**Time Smearing:**
- Large FFT (4096) = significant time smearing
- FFT size 4096 @ 48kHz = 85.3ms window
- Trade-off: better frequency resolution, worse time resolution
- Acceptable for pitch/time effects, but creates "phasiness"

**Frequency Resolution:**
- FFT size 4096 @ 48kHz = 11.7Hz per bin
- Excellent frequency resolution
- Good for pitch detection and shifting

**Phase Vocoder Artifacts:**
- Transient smearing (typical for phase vocoders)
- "Phasiness" on complex material
- Formant shifting when pitch shifting
- Pre-echo on transients

**Code Issues Detected:**
```cpp
// Line 496-497: Unused variables
const float smoothTimeStretch = timeStretchSmoother->tick();  // UNUSED
const float smoothPitchShift = pitchShiftSmoother->tick();    // UNUSED
```
These smoothed values are calculated but not used. May indicate incomplete implementation or optimization opportunity.

### Grading

| Criterion | Grade | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Stability** | B | Warnings about unused variables, reorder in constructor |
| **FFT Artifacts** | C+ | Large FFT causes significant time smearing (85ms window) |
| **Musicality** | B | Classic vocoder sound, but inherent artifacts |
| **Production Ready** | B | Functional but could use cleanup (unused variables) |
| **Bug Fix** | N/A | No recent bug fixes reported |

**Overall Grade: B**

**Strengths:**
- Large FFT provides excellent frequency resolution
- Comprehensive parameter set (10 parameters)
- Classic robotizer effect via phase reset
- Transient preservation with attack/release

**Weaknesses:**
- Significant time smearing from large FFT (85ms)
- Unused smoothed parameter variables (incomplete implementation?)
- Constructor initialization order warning
- Phase vocoder artifacts inherent to algorithm
- "Phasiness" on complex material

**Recommendations:**
- Use smoothed parameters or remove dead code
- Fix constructor initialization order
- Consider adaptive FFT size based on content
- Add formant preservation for more natural pitch shifting

## ENGINE 52: FeedbackNetwork

### Architecture Analysis

**NOT AN FFT ENGINE!**
This is a delay-based feedback network, not a spectral processor. It uses delay lines, not FFT.

**Configuration:**
- Delay lines (stereo pair)
- Maximum delay time configurable
- Modulation via LFO (phase-based)

**Key Features:**
- Cross-feed between channels
- Diffusion
- Modulation (depth control)
- Freeze capability
- Shimmer effect

**Parameters (8 total):**
0. DelayTime (seconds)
1. Feedback (0-1)
2. CrossFeed (0-1)
3. Diffusion (0-1)
4. Modulation (depth)
5. Freeze (0-1)
6. Shimmer (0-1)
7. Mix (dry/wet)

**Modulation Offset Fix (VERIFIED):**
```cpp
// Line 68-69: Modulation phases
double modPhaseL = 0.0;
double modPhaseR = 0.0;
```
Separate phase tracking for L/R prevents offset issues. The fix ensures independent modulation per channel.

### Stability Analysis

**Feedback Stability:**
- Sanitization function (line 72-74):
```cpp
inline float sanitize(float x) {
    return DSPUtils::flushDenorm(std::isfinite(x) ? x : 0.0f);
}
```
- Checks for finite values
- Flushes denormals
- Should prevent runaway feedback

**Potential Issues:**
- High feedback + high modulation could still cause instability
- No explicit feedback limiting (soft clipping, etc.)
- Relies on isfinite() check

### Grading

| Criterion | Grade | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Stability** | B+ | Sanitization helps, but high feedback may be unstable |
| **FFT Artifacts** | N/A | Not an FFT-based engine (delay-based) |
| **Musicality** | A | Feedback networks are inherently musical |
| **Production Ready** | B+ | Modulation fix verified, but needs stability testing |
| **Bug Fix Verified** | YES | Separate L/R modulation phases prevent offset |

**Overall Grade: B+**

**Strengths:**
- Modulation offset fix properly implemented
- Sanitization prevents inf/NaN
- Creative feedback network design
- Cross-feed and diffusion for stereo width

**Weaknesses:**
- No soft clipping on feedback path
- High feedback + modulation stability untested
- Could benefit from adaptive feedback limiting
- Denormal guard unused (line 39)

**Recommendations:**
- Add soft clipping to feedback path (tanh, soft clip, etc.)
- Test extreme settings (feedback = 0.99, modulation = 1.0)
- Implement adaptive feedback limiting
- Use the denormal guard or remove it

## FFT ARTIFACT METHODOLOGY

### Analysis Framework

**1. Pre-Ringing**
- Measurement: Output energy before first input transient
- Cause: Non-causal window functions (Hann, Hamming, etc.)
- Typical values: 0.5-2ms for Hann window
- Acceptability: <5ms for creative effects, <1ms for transparent processing

**2. Time Smearing**
- Measurement: Decay time after transient (-60dB point)
- Cause: Windowing and overlap-add
- Formula: Effective time resolution ≈ FFT_size / (overlap_factor * sample_rate)
- Acceptability: Depends on application (10-50ms for creative, <5ms for transparent)

**3. Frequency Resolution**
- Measurement: FFT bin width
- Formula: Δf = sample_rate / FFT_size
- Uncertainty principle: Δf * Δt ≈ 1
- Trade-off: Better frequency resolution = worse time resolution

**4. Window Overlap Quality**
- Measurement: RMS variance across overlap-add frames
- Cause: Imperfect overlap-add reconstruction
- Target: >95% smoothness (RMS variance < 5% of mean)
- Formula: Quality = 1 - (variance / mean²)

**5. THD (Total Harmonic Distortion)**
- Measurement: Ratio of harmonic energy to fundamental
- Cause: Non-linearities in processing
- Target: <1% for transparent, <5% for creative

**6. Noise Floor**
- Measurement: RMS of quietest 10% of signal (dB)
- Target: <-80dB for hi-fi, <-60dB acceptable
