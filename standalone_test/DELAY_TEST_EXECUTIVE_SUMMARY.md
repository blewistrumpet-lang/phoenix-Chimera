**Date:** October 11, 2025
**Mission:** Test delay engines with real-world musical materials
**Status:** COMPLETE - CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

---

## TESTED ENGINES

- **Grade:** D
- **Status:** NOT PRODUCTION READY
- **Timing Accuracy:** 2/5 (40%)
- **Feedback Stability:** 6/6 (100%)

### Bucket Brigade Delay (Engine ID: 37)
- **Grade:** F
- **Status:** COMPLETELY BROKEN
- **Timing Accuracy:** 0/5 (0%)
- **Feedback Stability:** 6/6 (100%)

## CRITICAL FINDINGS

### Digital Delay - THREE MAJOR ISSUES

1. **CRITICAL BUG: 2000ms Delay Failure**
   - Returns -2.1ms instead of 2000ms
   - Indicates buffer overflow or parameter mapping bug
   - **Blocker for production use**

2. **Timing Inaccuracy**
   - Errors of 1.23ms and 1.77ms exceed ±1ms tolerance
   - 50ms and 1000ms tests pass, others fail
   - Inconsistent accuracy across delay range

3. **No Stereo Imaging**
   - Stereo width: 0.000 (essentially mono)
   - Ping-pong mode not functioning
   - Both channels output identical signals

### Bucket Brigade Delay - COMPLETE FAILURE

1. **CRITICAL: Fixed Delay Time**
   - ALL delay times measure 21.3ms
   - Parameter changes have ZERO effect
   - Clock rate control completely broken
   - **Cannot be used for any delay application**

2. **Parameter System Disconnected**
   - updateParameters() not affecting BBD clock
   - Atomic variables may have sync issues
   - Requires complete parameter system investigation

---

## WHAT WORKS

### Both Engines - Excellent Stability
- **Feedback Stability:** 100% pass rate (0% to 95% feedback)
- **No Runaway:** Even at extreme 95% feedback
- **Click-Free:** Smooth parameter transitions
- **Clean Processing:** No digital artifacts

This is actually impressive - both engines have rock-solid feedback loops.

### Digital Delay (2.2MB each)
- `Digital_Delay_guitar.wav` - Clean picked guitar

## ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED

### Digital Delay

**Issue 1: 2000ms Bug**
```
Root Cause: Buffer size calculation or bounds checking
Location: Delay time parameter mapping
Fix: Add buffer bounds checking and validation
```

**Issue 2: Timing Errors**
```
Root Cause: Rounding in sample calculation or interpolation
Location: Sample-to-millisecond conversion
Fix: Use double precision, improve interpolation
```

**Issue 3: Stereo Width**
```
Root Cause: Crossfeed amount too low (0.3)
Location: Ping-pong processing
Fix: Increase crossfeed, add true ping-pong mode
```

### Bucket Brigade Delay

**Issue: Fixed Delay Time**
```
Root Cause: Clock rate not responding to parameters
Location: updateParameters() → BBD clock connection
Fix: Verify parameter index, check atomic sync
Priority: CRITICAL - Engine is unusable
```

1. Fix 2000ms buffer overflow bug (HIGH PRIORITY)
2. Improve timing accuracy to ±1ms (HIGH PRIORITY)
