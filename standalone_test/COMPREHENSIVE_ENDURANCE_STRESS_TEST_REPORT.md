**Test Observations:**
During the test, the following was observed:
1. Multiple IR reloads occurred during test (logged):
   - Initial load: IR 0 (144,000 samples, 2 channels)
   - Mid-test reload: IR 2 (192,000 samples → damped to 76,800)
2. Each reload triggered by parameter changes
3. Old buffers not being released

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- **Primary Issue:** Re-allocating IR buffers on every parameter change without freeing old buffers
- ConvolutionReverb is triggering expensive IR reload/recalculation on every block or parameter update
- IR buffer lifecycle management completely broken
- Likely calling `loadImpulseResponse()` repeatedly
- No caching of IR buffers
- Max block time (6ms) indicates IR processing happening in audio thread

**Diagnostic Log:**
```
ConvolutionReverb: Initializing with sampleRate=48000.0, samplesPerBlock=512
ConvolutionReverb: Loading IR 0 at sample rate 48000.0
ConvolutionReverb: IR generated - Length: 144000, Channels: 2
... [processing] ...
ConvolutionReverb: Loading IR 2 at sample rate 48000.0  # ❌ Mid-test reload!
ConvolutionReverb: IR generated - Length: 192000, Channels: 2
ConvolutionReverb: Applying damping - param=0.8
ConvolutionReverb: Final IR stats - Length: 76800, Channels: 2
```

**Fix Priority:** CRITICAL - Must fix before production

**Recommended Fixes:**
1. Cache IR buffers - don't reallocate on parameter changes
2. Move IR loading to preparation phase only
3. Implement proper buffer cleanup in destructor
4. Use parameter smoothing instead of IR reloading
5. Profile with Instruments to verify fix

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)
1. **Fix Engine 41 Plate Reverb** - CRITICAL
   - Implement IR buffer caching
   - Move IR loading out of audio thread
   - Add proper buffer cleanup

2. **Fix Engine 40 Shimmer Reverb** - CRITICAL
   - Add DC blocking filter
   - Implement amplitude normalization
   - Fix pitch shifter output

3. **Profile Engine 36** - CRITICAL
   - Use Instruments Time Profiler
   - Identify hot spots
   - Optimize algorithm

### Short Term (Weeks 2-3)
4. Fix Engine 39 Convolution Reverb memory leak
5. Add high-pass filters to delay engines (34, 35, 38)
6. Profile and optimize Spring/Gated reverbs (42, 43)

### Medium Term (Month 1-2)
7. Investigate common performance degradation cause
8. Review all circular buffer management
9. Implement comprehensive memory leak testing CI

### Performance Degradation Investigation
The fact that ALL engines show performance degradation (190-6000%) suggests a common root cause:

**Possible Causes:**
1. Cache misses from memory fragmentation
2. Accumulating state in DSP algorithms
3. Heap fragmentation from repeated allocations
4. Virtual memory page thrashing
5. System-level issue (unlikely given localized nature)

**Recommended Investigation:**
- Profile with Instruments (Time Profiler + Allocations)
- Check for repeated small allocations in audio thread
- Monitor cache miss rates
- Review use of `std::vector` and dynamic allocations in `process()` methods
- Check for accumulating state in reverb tails/delay lines

### Test Suite Capabilities
The comprehensive endurance suite (`test_endurance_suite.cpp`) includes:

1. **Memory Stability Test (30 minutes)**
   - All 56 engines
   - Measures memory every 10 seconds
   - Fails if growth > 1 MB/min

2. **CPU Stability Test (30 minutes)**
   - Continuous processing
   - Tracks CPU drift over time
   - Fails if drift > 20%

3. **Parameter Stability Test (10 minutes)**
   - Continuous LFO modulation
   - All parameters automated
   - Checks for drift/instability

4. **Buffer Overflow Test (5 minutes)**
   - Tests buffer sizes: 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192

### Usage
```bash
# Build (requires pre-built object files)
./build_endurance_suite.sh

# Run specific test on specific engine
cd build && ./endurance_suite 1 41    # Memory test on Plate Reverb
cd build && ./endurance_suite 1 40    # Memory test on Shimmer Reverb
cd build && ./endurance_suite 1 36    # Memory test on Magnetic Drum

# Run all tests on critical engines
cd build && ./endurance_suite 0 40    # All tests on Shimmer
cd build && ./endurance_suite 0 41    # All tests on Plate
```

**Note:** Full test suite (all engines, all tests) would take ~40 hours. Run targeted tests on critical engines instead.

---

## CONCLUSION

The endurance testing has successfully identified **3 critical production blockers** and revealed that **long-term stability testing is essential** for catching issues missed by short tests.

**Key Learnings:**
1. Time-domain coverage matters - 15% is insufficient
2. Memory leaks only appear after minutes of testing
3. Performance degradation is a systemic issue
4. Most short tests miss these critical problems

**Production Readiness:**
- ❌ **NOT READY** for production deployment
- **Estimated time to production:** 6-8 weeks
- **Critical path:** Fix Engines 40, 41, 36

**Next Steps:**
1. Fix critical engines (Week 1)
2. Implement fixes for high-priority issues (Week 2-3)
3. Re-run 30-minute endurance tests (Week 4)
4. Full validation testing (Week 5-6)
5. Production deployment (Week 7-8)
