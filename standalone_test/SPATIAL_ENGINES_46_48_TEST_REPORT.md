## Test Methodology

### Stereo Correlation Measurement

The test framework measures stereo spatial characteristics using multiple metrics:

#### 1. **Interchannel Correlation**
```
correlation = Σ(L*R) / sqrt(Σ(L²) * Σ(R²))
```
- **1.0** = Perfect mono (identical L/R)
- **0.0** = Completely uncorrelated stereo
- **-1.0** = Inverted channels

#### 2. **Stereo Width**
```
mid = (L + R) / 2
side = (L - R) / 2
width = RMS(side) / RMS(mid)
```
- **0.0** = Mono
- **1.0** = Normal stereo
- **>1.0** = Enhanced stereo width

#### 3. **Mono Compatibility**
```
mono_sum = (L + R) / 2
compatibility = peak(mono_sum) / peak(stereo)
```
- **>0.7** = Good mono compatibility
- **<0.5** = Phase cancellation issues

#### 4. **Phase Coherence**
FFT-based phase relationship analysis across frequency bands:
- 100 Hz, 500 Hz, 1kHz, 2kHz, 5kHz, 10kHz test points
- Hann windowing, 2048-point FFT
- Phase shift measurement in degrees

## Detailed Test Results

### Engine 46: Dimension Expander
**Status**: ⚪ NOT TESTED

**Engine Purpose**: Stereo spatial expansion with dimension enhancement

**Expected Behavior**:
- Increase stereo width without phase issues
- Maintain mono compatibility > 0.7
- Progressive width increase with parameter

**Test Requirements** (Not Yet Executed):
```cpp
// Test with mono input at different expansion levels
float expansionLevels[] = {0.0f, 0.33f, 0.67f, 1.0f};

Expected Results:
- Expansion 0%:   Correlation ~1.0, Width ~0.0
- Expansion 33%:  Correlation ~0.7, Width ~0.5
- Expansion 67%:  Correlation ~0.4, Width ~1.2
- Expansion 100%: Correlation ~0.2, Width ~2.0
```

**Recommendation**: **URGENT** - Test required before production use

---

### Engine 47: Spectral Freeze
**Status**: ⚪ NOT TESTED (Individual test)

**Engine Purpose**: Freeze spectral content while preserving spatial characteristics

**Related Test Data**: Phase Align (Engine 56) tested with similar spectral processing

**Expected Behavior**:
- Maintain stereo image during freeze
- Preserve phase relationships
- No artifacts from FFT windowing

**Available Phase Data** (from Engine 56 test):
```
Frequency | Phase Shift | Status
----------|-------------|-------
100 Hz    | -9.2°      | ✓ Good
500 Hz    | -51.4°     | ✓ OK
1000 Hz   | +176.9°    | ✗ Large shift
2000 Hz   | +168.4°    | ✗ Large shift
5000 Hz   | +166.8°    | ✗ Large shift
10000 Hz  | -85.5°     | ⚠️ Moderate
```

**Known Issue**: If Spectral Freeze uses same phase processing as Phase Align, it will have accuracy issues above 500 Hz.

**Recommendation**: **HIGH PRIORITY** - Test phase preservation during freeze

Width,Correlation,MidLevel,SideLevel,StereoWidth,MonoCompatibility
0,    1.0,       0.338,   0.0,      0.0,        1.0
50,   1.0,       0.338,   0.0,      0.0,        1.0
100,  1.0,       0.338,   0.0,      0.0,        1.0
```

**Analysis**: **PARAMETER NOT CONNECTED** - no stereo width effect detected at any setting

**Impact on Engines 46-48**: If Engine 44 (basic widener) is broken, Engine 46 (Dimension Expander) may have similar parameter mapping issues.

### Engine 56: Phase Align Platinum (Related Spatial Engine)
**Status**: 🟡 **PARTIAL** - Works well in bass, fails in mids/highs

**Test Data**:
```csv
Frequency,PhaseShift,GroupDelay,Correction
100,      -9.2,      0,         13.3
500,      -51.4,     0,         60.4
1000,     +176.9,    0,         176.9  (no correction)
2000,     +168.4,    0,         168.4  (no correction)
5000,     +166.8,    0,         166.8  (no correction)
```

**Analysis**: Phase correction effective below 500 Hz, but fails in midrange (1-5 kHz)

**Impact on Engines 46-48**: If Engine 47 (Spectral Freeze) uses phase processing, it may inherit these limitations.

## Stereo Metrics Explanation

### For Users

**Correlation**: How similar left and right channels are
- **1.0** = Mono (same signal)
- **0.5** = Wide stereo (partially different)
- **0.0** = Completely independent channels
- **Negative** = Out of phase (avoid)

**Width**: How "wide" the stereo image feels
- **0.0** = Mono
- **1.0** = Normal stereo separation
- **2.0+** = Exaggerated width (use carefully)

**Mono Compatibility**: What happens when summed to mono
- **1.0** = Perfect (no loss)
- **0.7** = Good (slight loss acceptable)
- **<0.5** = Poor (phase cancellation)

### For Developers

```cpp
// Stereo correlation coefficient
float correlation = sumLR / sqrt(sumLL * sumRR);

// Mid/side analysis
float mid = (left + right) * 0.5f;
float side = (left - right) * 0.5f;
float width = RMS(side) / RMS(mid);

// Phase analysis (FFT)
complex<float> inputFFT[fftSize];
complex<float> outputFFT[fftSize];
float phaseShift = arg(outputFFT[bin]) - arg(inputFFT[bin]);
```

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Spatial Processing Architecture

Based on Engine 48 test results, ChimeraPhoenix spatial engines appear to use:

1. **FFT-based processing** (2048-point)
2. **Stereo-linked processing** (maintains L/R relationship)
3. **Hann windowing** (minimal artifacts)
4. **50% overlap** (typical for quality)

### Expected Engine Behavior

**Engine 46 (Dimension Expander)**:
- Likely uses decorrelation filters
- May employ all-pass filters for phase diversity
- Should maintain mono compatibility

**Engine 47 (Spectral Freeze)**:
- Freezes FFT bins selectively
- Must preserve phase between L/R channels
- Envelope interpolation for smooth transitions

**Engine 48 (Spectral Gate)**:
- Threshold-based bin attenuation
- Stereo-linked to prevent image shift
- Smooth attack/release (no zipper noise observed)
