## CRITICAL ISSUES & RECOMMENDATIONS

### HIGH PRIORITY (Pre-Release Blockers)

1. **ConvolutionReverb Memory Leak (Engine 43)**
   - **Issue:** Memory accumulation over long sessions
   - **Fix:** Apply PlateReverb memory leak fix
   - **Status:** In progress
   - **Timeline:** 1-2 hours
   - **Blocker:** YES - must fix before release

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Documentation)

2. **Pre-Delay Documentation Mismatch (Engines 39, 41)**
   - **Issue:** Headers claim 0-200ms, implementation is 0-100ms
   - **Affected:** PlateReverb.h, ShimmerReverb.h
   - **Fix:** Update headers to reflect actual 100ms OR extend implementation to 200ms
   - **Priority:** Medium (functionality correct, docs wrong)
   - **Timeline:** 30 minutes

3. **PlateReverb Modulation Parameters (Engine 39)**
   - **Issue:** Parameters 5-6 (Modulation Rate/Depth) documented but not implemented
   - **Fix:** Either implement vintage modulation OR update docs to reflect freeze mode
   - **Priority:** Medium (parameters unused)
   - **Timeline:** 2-4 hours (if implementing) or 15 minutes (if doc update)

### LOW PRIORITY (Enhancements)

4. **Extended RT60 Testing**
   - **Current:** 1-second test buffer
   - **Recommended:** 10-second buffer for full decay analysis
   - **Benefits:** More accurate RT60 measurements, modal density analysis
   - **Priority:** Low (current tests sufficient for validation)

5. **Convolution IR Export**
   - **Feature:** Save generated IRs to WAV files
   - **Benefits:** Offline analysis, preset sharing
   - **Priority:** Low (nice-to-have feature)
