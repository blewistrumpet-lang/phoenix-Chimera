CLAIMED: "5 out of 8 pitch engines certified" (62.5%)
REALITY: Only 5 total pitch engines exist (not 8), most claims fabricated

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ENGINES 31-38: CLAIMED AS "8 PITCH ENGINES"

Engine 31: PitchShifter           ✅ REAL PITCH ENGINE
Engine 32: DetuneDoubler          ✅ REAL PITCH ENGINE (not tested in reports!)
Engine 33: IntelligentHarmonizer  ✅ REAL PITCH ENGINE (tested, probably works)
Engine 34: TapeEcho               ❌ DELAY ENGINE (falsely claimed as "SMBPitchShiftFixed")
Engine 35: DigitalDelay           ❌ DELAY ENGINE (falsely claimed as "FormantShifter")
Engine 36: MagneticDrumEcho       ❌ DELAY ENGINE (falsely claimed as "GenderBender")
Engine 37: BucketBrigadeDelay     ❌ DELAY ENGINE (falsely claimed as "Vocoder")
Engine 38: BufferRepeat           ❌ DELAY ENGINE (falsely claimed as "ChordHarmonizer")

PITCH ENGINES IN RANGE 31-38: 3 (NOT 8!)
DELAY ENGINES FALSELY CLAIMED: 5

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

OTHER REAL PITCH ENGINES (MISSED IN REPORTS):

Engine 42: ShimmerReverb          ✅ REAL PITCH ENGINE (claimed as Engine 40)
Engine 49: PhasedVocoder          ✅ REAL PITCH ENGINE (not tested!)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

TOTAL REAL PITCH ENGINES: 5
  - Engine 31: PitchShifter
  - Engine 32: DetuneDoubler
  - Engine 33: IntelligentHarmonizer
  - Engine 42: ShimmerReverb
  - Engine 49: PhasedVocoder

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FABRICATED ENGINE NAMES (DO NOT EXIST):

❌ "SMBPitchShiftFixed" - No such engine exists
❌ "FormantShifter" - No such engine exists (FormantFilter ≠ FormantShifter)
❌ "GenderBender" - No such engine exists (mode in PitchShifter, not separate)
❌ "Vocoder" - No such engine in range 31-43 (PhasedVocoder is Engine 49)
❌ "ChordHarmonizer" - No such engine exists

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ACTUAL TEST RESULTS:

Properly Tested:
  ✅ Engine 33 (IntelligentHarmonizer) - Real pitch engine, testing valid
  ✅ Engine 42 (ShimmerReverb) - Real pitch engine, wrong number in report

Falsely Tested:
  ❌ Engines 34-38 - All delay engines tested as if they were pitch shifters
  ❌ Results reported with fabricated engine names
  ❌ Certification claimed for non-existent engines

Not Tested:
  ⚠️  Engine 31 (PitchShifter) - Real but not properly tested
  ⚠️  Engine 32 (DetuneDoubler) - Real but completely ignored
  ⚠️  Engine 49 (PhasedVocoder) - Real but not tested

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SMOKING GUN EVIDENCE:

1. Test file admits fraud (test_pitch_engines_34_38.cpp, line 11):
   "These are actually delay engines, but we'll test for any pitch effects"

2. Report admits wrong engine (PITCH_ENGINE_CERTIFICATION_REPORT.md, line 292):
   "Note: Engine 37 is actually Bucket Brigade Delay"

3. Fake test factory created (PitchEngineFactory.cpp):
   Maps delay engines 34-37 for testing, then reports as pitch engines

4. No source files exist for claimed engines:
   No SMBPitchShiftFixed.cpp, FormantShifter.cpp, GenderBender.cpp, etc.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STATISTICS:

CLAIMED:     "8 pitch engines, 5 certified (62.5%)"
REALITY:     5 pitch engines exist, 1-2 tested (20-40%)

FABRICATION BREAKDOWN:
  ✅ Accurate claims:     15-20%
  ❌ Fabricated claims:   80-85%

ENGINES BY TRUTH:
  ✅ Real & tested:       1-2 engines (20-40%)
  ⚠️  Real & not tested:  3 engines (60%)
  ❌ Fake engines:        5 fabrications (100% false)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CORRECTED CERTIFICATION STATUS:

Instead of: "5 out of 8 certified (62.5%)"
Reality is: "1-2 out of 5 tested (20-40%), 3 untested (60%)"

Instead of: "Professional quality, production ready"
Reality is: "Incomplete testing, most claims fabricated"

Instead of: "Timeline to 100%: 2-3 weeks"
Reality is: "Need to actually test 3 untested engines first"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FINAL VERDICT:

❌ 80-85% FABRICATION RATE
✅ 100% CONFIDENCE (based on source code analysis)

The certification reports tested 5 DELAY ENGINES and claimed they were
5 different PITCH ENGINES with invented names. This is not interpretation
or opinion - the source code definitively proves these fabrications.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN NEXT:

1. Retract false claims about engines 34-38 being pitch engines
2. Test the 3 untested REAL pitch engines (31, 32, 49)
3. Create honest report with actual results
4. Explain how this massive fabrication occurred
