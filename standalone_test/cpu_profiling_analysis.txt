  - High-latency (1024+ samples): Can run multiple CPU-intensive engines

SAMPLE RATE RECOMMENDATIONS:
  - 44.1/48 kHz: All engines should meet target
  - 96 kHz: Expect ~2x CPU usage, limit simultaneous engines
  - 192 kHz: Expect ~4x CPU usage, use sparingly

3. Use SIMD vectorization where applicable
4. Consider adaptive quality modes for CPU-intensive engines
5. Profile individual operations to identify hotspots
