**Date:** October 11, 2025
**Test Framework:** test_parameter_interactions.cpp
**Report Location:** PARAMETER_INTERACTION_TESTING_REPORT.md

---

## Overview

This comprehensive testing suite analyzed parameter interactions across all 56 audio processing engines in Chimera Phoenix v3.0. Unlike traditional single-parameter testing, this deep analysis examined how parameters interact with each other - identifying synergistic effects, conflicts, and dangerous combinations.

## Test Methodology

### Interaction Testing Approach

For each engine, we tested critical parameter pairs with 7 different value combinations:
1. Both Min (0.0, 0.0)
2. Both Max (1.0, 1.0)
3. P1 Min + P2 Max (0.0, 1.0)
4. P1 Max + P2 Min (1.0, 0.0)
5. Both Low (0.3, 0.3)
6. Both Mid (0.5, 0.5)
7. Both High (0.7, 0.7)

### Failure Detection

Tests failed if they exhibited:
- **NaN/Inf Output:** Invalid floating-point values in audio buffer
- **Instability:** Signal growth beyond 10.0 peak amplitude
- **Silent Output:** Unexpected silence after warmup
- **Excessive Levels:** Peak exceeds 5.0 (clipping risk)

### Test Conditions

- **Sample Rate:** 48kHz
- **Block Size:** 512 samples
- **Test Signal:** 440Hz sine wave at -3dB (-9.5dB RMS)
- **Processing Duration:** 50 blocks per test (~533ms)
- **Total Tests Run:** 4,067 parameter interaction tests
