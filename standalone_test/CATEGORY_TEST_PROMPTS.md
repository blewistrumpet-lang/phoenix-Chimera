55. Gain Utility Platinum
56. Mono Maker Platinum

UTILITY-SPECIFIC METRICS:

1. **Gain Utility (55)**
   - **Gain Accuracy**: Set +6dB, measure actual gain (should be exactly 6.00dB Â±0.01dB)
   - **Test range**: -40dB to +20dB in 1dB steps
   - **THD at all gain settings**: Should be <0.001% (better than 0.5%)
   - **Phase response**: Must be linear (no phase shift)
   - **Latency**: Should be 0 samples (instant)
   - **Channel independence**: Verify L/R are truly independent
   - **Automation smoothing**: Test for zipper noise when gain changes rapidly

2. **Mono Maker (56)**
   - **Mono summing accuracy**: (L+R)/2 or (L+R)/â2? Test both
   - **Phase preservation**: Verify no phase rotation
   - **Gain compensation**: Check if output is same loudness as input
   - **Frequency response**: Flat 20Hz-20kHz (Â±0.1dB)
   - **THD**: Should be 0.000% (literally bit-perfect sum)
   - **Latency**: Should be 0 samples

3. **Edge Cases for Both**
   - Test with DC offset input (should pass through or remove?)
   - Test with silent input (should stay silent)
   - Test with max level input (Â±1.0, should not clip)
   - Test with denormal numbers (very quiet signals)

CRITICAL TESTS:

1. **Gain Utility - Precision Test**
   - Input: 0dBFS sine wave (amplitude 1.0)
   - Set gain: +6.0206dB (exactly 2x in linear)
   - Measure output: Should be EXACTLY 2.000000 (not 1.999 or 2.001)
   - Test at all frequencies: 20Hz, 100Hz, 1kHz, 10kHz, 20kHz
   - Verify bit-perfect multiplication

2. **Mono Maker - Stereo Cancellation Test**
   - Input L: +1.0, Input R: -1.0 (perfect phase inversion)
   - Output should be: 0.0 (complete cancellation)
   - Test with various phase relationships
   - Verify no "residual stereo" leak

3. **Both - Real-time Safety**
   - Should be fastest engines (simple math operations)
   - No heap allocation
   - No complex calculations
   - CPU usage should be <0.1%

YOUR DELIVERABLES:

1. Create `utility_test.cpp` with:
   - Precision gain measurement
   - THD verification at multiple gains
   - Phase response test
   - Mono summing verification
   - Automation smoothing test

2. Generate CSV files:
   - `gain_utility_accuracy.csv` (set vs measured gain)
   - `mono_maker_cancellation.csv` (phase tests)

3. Create `UTILITY_QUALITY_REPORT.md` with:
   - Gain accuracy (Â±0.01dB tolerance)
   - THD measurements (should be <0.001%)
   - Latency verification (0 samples)
   - CPU usage (<0.1%)
   - Phase linearity
   - Comparison to professional tools (should match bit-perfect)

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Gain accuracy: Â±0.01dB
- THD: <0.001% (better than current 0.000%)
- Phase: Linear (0Â° shift at all frequencies)
- Latency: 0 samples
- Mono summing: Bit-perfect (L+R)/2
- No automation zipper noise

## GENERAL TESTING GUIDELINES (For All Prompts)

### Build System Pattern:
```bash
# Follow this pattern from reverb testing:
1. Create test file: category_test.cpp
2. Create build script: build_category_test.sh (based on build_reverb_test.sh)
3. Compile against existing object files in build/obj/
4. Link with JUCE framework and HarfBuzz
5. Generate standalone executable
```

### Test Output Requirements:
1. **CSV files**: For plotting/analysis
2. **Markdown report**: Human-readable quality assessment
3. **Console output**: Real-time progress with clear pass/fail indicators

### Quality Rating System (1-5 stars):
- â­â­â­â­â­ Professional grade (matches high-end commercial)
- â­â­â­â­ Production ready (matches mid-tier commercial)
- â­â­â­ Usable (works but has minor issues)
- â­â­ Needs work (functional but flawed)
- â­ Broken (not functional or severe quality issues)

### Comparison Benchmarks:
- Always compare to known hardware/software (e.g., "Similar to Neve 1073")
- Reference professional standards (e.g., THD <0.01% for clean signal path)
- Identify unique character vs defects

### Issue Severity:
- ð´ CRITICAL: Crashes, hangs, produces no sound
- â ï¸ HIGH: Quality issues (high THD, wrong behavior)
- ð¡ MEDIUM: Minor issues (slight inaccuracy, edge cases)
- ð¢ LOW: Cosmetic or nice-to-have improvements

### Success Criteria:
Each prompt should result in:
1. â All engines tested (or crash reason documented)
2. â Quality metrics measured
3. â Comparison to professional standards
4. â Issues prioritized by severity
5. â Specific recommendations for fixes

## EXECUTION STRATEGY

**Option 1: Sequential (One category per session)**
- Thorough and detailed
- Time: ~2-4 hours per category
- Total: 1-2 days

**Option 2: Parallel (Launch all agents simultaneously)**
- Fastest results
- Time: ~4-6 hours total
- May hit token limits

**Option 3: Hybrid (2-3 agents at once)**
- Balanced approach
- Time: ~8-12 hours
- Recommended strategy
