## Critical Issues & Required Fixes

### Priority 1: CRITICAL

#### Engine 27: Frequency Shifter - Non-Linear Shifting
**Issue:** Maximum error of 259.1 Hz (40.5% of target frequency)
**Impact:** Engine unusable for accurate frequency shifting
**Status:** ❌ NOT PRODUCTION READY

**Required Fix:**
```cpp
// Correct parameter mapping:
float shiftHz = (param - 0.5f) * 1000.0f;  // -500 to +500 Hz

// Verify:
// 1. Hilbert transform coefficients
// 2. SSB quadrature mixing
// 3. Increase oversampling to 4×
// 4. Add comprehensive linearity tests
```

**Test Criteria:** Error must be < 1 Hz for all shift amounts

---

### Priority 2: HIGH (None)
All high-priority issues have been resolved with LFO calibration fixes.

---

### Priority 3: LOW

#### Engine 30: Rotary Speaker - Speed Fine-Tuning
**Issue:** Rotor speeds close but not perfectly matching Leslie 122 specs
**Impact:** Good but not perfect Leslie character
**Status:** ⚠️ Usable, but could be improved

**Recommended Tuning:**
- Verify 6:1 horn:drum speed ratio
- Fine-tune slow mode: 0.7 Hz horn, 0.1 Hz drum
- Fine-tune fast mode: 6.7 Hz horn, 1.1 Hz drum
- Add brake function
