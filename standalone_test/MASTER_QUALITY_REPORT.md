## Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Release)

### üî¥ PRIORITY 1: SHOWSTOPPER BUGS

#### 1. Engine 15: Vintage Tube Preamp - INFINITE LOOP/HANG
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Impact**: Will freeze DAW, data loss for users
**Status**: BLOCKS ALL RELEASES

**Problem**:
- Engine hangs indefinitely during testing
- Never completes processing, never returns control
- Likely infinite loop in DSP processing or parameter update

**Reproduction**:
```bash
./standalone_test --engine 15
# Test never completes, hangs forever
```

**Likely Causes**:
1. While loop without proper exit condition
2. Recursive function with no base case
3. Circular parameter dependency
4. Buffer index calculation error leading to infinite iteration

**Fix Strategy**:
1. Add timeout protection (5 second max)
2. Add debug logging to identify last executed line before hang
3. Test with small buffer sizes (1, 2, 4 samples)
4. Review all loops for exit conditions
5. Check parameter update logic for circular dependencies

**Estimated Fix Time**: 2-4 hours
**File**: `VintageTubePreamp_Studio.cpp`

---

#### 2. Engine 41: Plate Reverb - ZERO OUTPUT (BROKEN ALGORITHM)
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Impact**: Appears completely broken to users
**Status**: BLOCKS REVERB CATEGORY RELEASE

**Problem**:
- Input impulse passes through (peak 0.767 at t=0)
- Output goes to absolute zero after 10ms
- No reverb tail, no early reflections, no diffusion
- This is not a reverb - it's a very short gate

**Impulse Response Analysis**:
```
Peak:              0.767 (at sample 0, dry signal)
Decay after 10ms:  -200 dB (complete silence)
Stereo:            1.000 (mono because it's just dry signal)
Echo Density:      0/sec (no reverb at all)
```

**Likely Causes**:
1. Feedback coefficient set to 0.0 (no recirculation)
2. Comb/allpass filters not initialized
3. wetLevel not being applied
4. Delay line buffer initialization issue

**Fix Strategy**:
1. Check feedback coefficient initialization
2. Verify comb filter feedback paths are connected
3. Add debug output to verify filter states
4. Compare to working Spring Reverb implementation
5. Test with known good plate reverb algorithm

**Estimated Fix Time**: 4-6 hours
**File**: `PlateReverb.cpp`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è PRIORITY 2: HIGH-SEVERITY BUGS

#### 3. Engine 32: Pitch Shifter - EXTREME THD (8.673%)
**Severity**: HIGH
**Impact**: Unusable for professional audio work
**Status**: BLOCKS PITCH CATEGORY RELEASE

**Problem**:
- THD 8.673% is 17x over 0.5% threshold
- For comparison: clean filters should be <0.01%
- This level of distortion is audible and unacceptable

**Likely Causes**:
1. Granular/PSOLA algorithm creating discontinuities between grains
2. Buffer underflow/overflow creating clicks
3. Coefficient quantization in pitch detection
4. FFT window artifacts (if using phase vocoder)
5. Missing anti-aliasing on pitch shift

**Fix Strategy**:
1. Measure THD at different shift amounts (-12 to +12 semitones)
2. Test with pure sine waves (100Hz, 440Hz, 1kHz, 4kHz)
3. Add oversampling (2x or 4x)
4. Improve grain windowing (use Hann or Blackman-Harris window)
5. Consider switching to elastique or rubber band library

**Estimated Fix Time**: 8-16 hours
**File**: `PitchShifter.cpp`

---

#### 4. Engine 9: Ladder Filter - HIGH THD (3.512%)
**Severity**: HIGH
**Impact**: Audible distortion even at neutral settings

**Problem**:
- THD 3.512% is 7x over threshold
- Moog ladder filters should be <0.1% THD when properly implemented
- This is the characteristic "warm" Moog sound taken too far

**Likely Causes**:
1. Filter instability at high resonance
2. Coefficient calculation precision issues
3. Missing linearization in non-linear elements
4. Tanh approximation quality
5. DC offset accumulation in feedback loop

**Fix Strategy**:
1. Test THD vs resonance (Q) setting
2. Test THD vs cutoff frequency
3. Add oversampling (2x minimum)
4. Improve tanh approximation accuracy
5. Add DC blocker in feedback path
6. Reference: Antti Huovilainen's Moog ladder paper

**Estimated Fix Time**: 6-12 hours
**File**: `LadderFilter.cpp`

---

#### 5. Engine 33: Intelligent Harmonizer - CRASHES
**Severity**: HIGH
**Impact**: Stability issue, may crash DAW

**Problem**:
- Test crashes during THD measurement
- Likely buffer overflow or assertion failure
- Unable to complete quality testing

**Fix Strategy**:
1. Run under debugger with breakpoint on crash
2. Add bounds checking on all array accesses
3. Verify buffer sizes are sufficient
4. Test with different input signals (sine, noise, speech, chord)
5. Add null pointer checks

**Estimated Fix Time**: 4-8 hours
**File**: `IntelligentHarmonizer_FINAL.cpp`

---

#### 6. Engine 52: Spectral Gate - STARTUP CRASH
**Severity**: HIGH
**Impact**: Non-functional, crashes immediately

**Problem**:
- Crashes on startup before processing begins
- Likely FFT buffer initialization issue

**Fix Strategy**:
1. Check FFT library compatibility
2. Verify buffer allocation sizes
3. Add null pointer checks
4. Test minimal initialization

**Estimated Fix Time**: 2-4 hours
**File**: `SpectralGate_Platinum.cpp`

---

#### 7. Engine 49: Pitch Shifter (duplicate) - NON-FUNCTIONAL
**Severity**: HIGH
**Impact**: Broken engine, confusing duplicate

**Problem**:
- Basic functionality test fails
- May be duplicate of Engine 32
- No output or immediate crash

**Fix Strategy**:
1. Determine if this is intentionally different from Engine 32
2. If duplicate, remove from engine list
3. If unique, debug why it fails basic tests

**Estimated Fix Time**: 1-2 hours

---

### üü° PRIORITY 3: MEDIUM-SEVERITY ISSUES

#### 8. Engine 6: Dynamic EQ - SLIGHTLY HIGH THD (0.759%)
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: May be acceptable for some uses, but above threshold

**Problem**:
- THD 0.759% vs 0.5% threshold (1.5x over)
- Still relatively low, but should be improved for "Platinum" quality

**Fix Strategy**:
1. Test THD at neutral settings (should be near 0%)
2. Measure THD vs EQ band activation
3. Check if specific frequency bands cause distortion
4. Test with different Q values

**Estimated Fix Time**: 4-6 hours
**File**: `DynamicEQ.cpp`

---

#### 9. Engine 40: Shimmer Reverb - MONO OUTPUT (Should be Stereo)
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: Loss of stereo image, less immersive

**Problem**:
- Stereo correlation: 0.889 (nearly mono)
- Should be <0.5 for professional reverb
- All other reverbs have excellent stereo (0.004-0.005)

**Analysis**:
- Shimmer effect works (strong signal, good diffusion)
- Pre-delay is 137ms (long but may be intentional)
- Echo density 5413/sec is good
- Only issue is lack of stereo width

**Fix Strategy**:
1. Check pitch shifter stereo processing (shimmer uses pitch shift)
2. Verify separate L/R processing paths
3. Add stereo spread to pitch-shifted signal
4. Test with Mid-Side processing

**Estimated Fix Time**: 2-4 hours
**File**: `ShimmerReverb.cpp`

#### 10. Engine 39: Convolution Reverb - PARAMETER VALIDATION FAILS
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: May work but with limited control

**Problem**:
- Parameter test fails in test harness
- Reverb quality is excellent (see impulse response)
- May be test harness issue rather than engine issue

**Fix Strategy**:
1. Test parameter changes in actual plugin
2. Verify parameter range validation
3. Check if parameters respond correctly

**Estimated Fix Time**: 1-2 hours

---

### üü¢ PRIORITY 4: LOW-SEVERITY ISSUES

#### 11. Engine 20: Muff Fuzz - SLIGHTLY HIGH CPU (5.19%)
**Severity**: LOW
**Impact**: Minor performance impact

**Problem**:
- CPU 5.19% vs 5.0% threshold (marginal)
- Still reasonable for a fuzz effect
- Not a blocking issue

**Fix Strategy**:
1. Profile to find hot spots
2. Optimize filter processing
3. Reduce oversampling if present

**Estimated Fix Time**: 2-4 hours
**File**: `MuffFuzz.cpp`
