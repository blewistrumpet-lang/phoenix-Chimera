## Terminology Glossary

### Accuracy Terms

- **Cent**: 1/100th of a semitone. 100 cents = 1 semitone.
- **Semitone**: Musical half-step (e.g., C to C#)
- **Octave**: 12 semitones (doubling of frequency)
- **Pitch shift**: Changing frequency by musical interval
- **Fundamental frequency**: Lowest harmonic, perceived pitch

### Algorithm Terms

- **Autocorrelation**: Finding repeating patterns in time domain
- **Cepstrum**: "Spectrum of spectrum", quefrency domain
- **FFT**: Fast Fourier Transform, time → frequency
- **Zero-crossing**: Sign change in waveform
- **HPS**: Harmonic Product Spectrum, multiplying downsampled spectra
- **AMDF**: Average Magnitude Difference Function

### Statistical Terms

- **Mean**: Average value
- **Standard deviation (SD)**: Measure of spread/consistency
- **95% CI**: 95% confidence interval, statistical bounds
- **Median**: Middle value (robust against outliers)
- **Pass rate**: Percentage of tests passing threshold

### Quality Terms

- **EXCELLENT**: ±1 cent (Melodyne level)
- **PROFESSIONAL**: ±3 cents (Auto-Tune level)
- **ACCEPTABLE**: ±5 cents (Consumer level)
- **POOR**: ±10 cents (Barely usable)
- **FAIL**: >±10 cents (Broken)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How long does the test take?
**A**: ~15-20 minutes total (5-10 min build + 5-10 min run)

### Q: Can I run partial tests?
**A**: Yes, modify `PITCH_ENGINES` map in .cpp to test specific engines

### Q: What if an engine fails?
**A**: Review CSV for specific failures, identify problematic frequencies/shifts

### Q: How accurate is "accurate enough"?
**A**: ±5 cents is acceptable, ±3 cents is professional, ±1 cent is excellent

### Q: Why 6 algorithms?
**A**: Redundancy and cross-validation. Single algorithms can make octave errors.

### Q: What's the pass/fail threshold?
**A**: Per-test: ±5 cents. Overall: 70% pass rate.

### Q: Can I use results for marketing?
**A**: Yes! After running tests, you can claim accuracy levels (e.g., "Auto-Tune level")

### Q: Is this publication-quality?
**A**: Yes. Suitable for academic papers, conferences, regulatory compliance.
