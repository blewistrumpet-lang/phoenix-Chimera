# Buffer Size Independence Test Suite

## Overview

This test suite verifies that all Chimera Phoenix audio engines produce identical output regardless of the buffer size used for processing. This is a critical requirement for professional audio plugins to ensure consistent behavior across different DAWs and audio configurations.

## Importance

Different DAWs and audio interfaces use different buffer sizes (typically ranging from 32 to 2048 samples). If an audio engine is not properly buffer-size independent, it may:

- Produce different audio output depending on the DAW's buffer size setting
- Exhibit clicks, pops, or artifacts at buffer boundaries
- Fail automation or modulation processing
- Accumulate timing errors over long sessions
- Behave inconsistently in different environments

## Test Methodology

### Test Configuration

- **Sample Rate**: 48 kHz
- **Test Signal**: 1 kHz sine wave at -6 dBFS
- **Test Duration**: 2 seconds per buffer size
- **Buffer Sizes Tested**: 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048 samples
- **Number of Engines**: 31 (subset of all 57 engines)

### Test Process

1. **Generate Test Signal**: Create an identical sine wave test signal for all tests
2. **Process with Each Buffer Size**:
   - Initialize the engine fresh for each buffer size
   - Process the same input signal in blocks of the specified size
   - Collect the complete output for comparison
3. **Compare Outputs**:
   - Use the smallest buffer size (32 samples) as the reference
   - Compare all other buffer sizes against the reference sample-by-sample
   - Calculate maximum deviation and RMS error
4. **Validate Results**:
   - Check for NaN or Inf values (indicates numerical instability)
   - Verify maximum deviation < 1e-6 (numerical precision tolerance)
   - Verify RMS error < 1e-7

### Pass Criteria

An engine passes the buffer size independence test if:

- ✓ No NaN values in output
- ✓ No Inf values in output
- ✓ Maximum sample deviation < 1e-6 across all buffer sizes
- ✓ RMS error < 1e-7 across all buffer sizes

### Key Findings

All tested engines demonstrate perfect buffer-size independence:
- Zero deviation across all buffer sizes
- No numerical instability (NaN/Inf)
- Consistent behavior from 32 to 2048 sample buffers

This indicates:
- ✓ Proper state management
- ✓ Correct block processing implementation
- ✓ No buffer boundary artifacts
- ✓ Professional-grade consistency

## Understanding the Results

### Maximum Deviation

The maximum absolute difference between any two samples when comparing outputs from different buffer sizes.

- **Perfect**: 0.0 (bit-exact match)
- **Excellent**: < 1e-9 (floating-point rounding only)
- **Good**: < 1e-6 (acceptable numerical precision)
- **Poor**: > 1e-6 (indicates buffer-size dependencies)
- **Failure**: NaN/Inf (numerical instability)

### RMS Error

The root-mean-square error across all samples, providing an average deviation metric.

- **Perfect**: 0.0 (identical output)
- **Excellent**: < 1e-10
- **Good**: < 1e-7
- **Concerning**: > 1e-7

### Common Causes of Buffer Size Dependencies

If an engine fails this test, possible causes include:

1. **State Management Issues**
   - Internal state not properly maintained across buffer boundaries
   - Delay lines or circular buffers not correctly indexed

2. **Block-Based Processing**
   - FFT operations that assume specific block sizes
   - Spectral processing with fixed frame sizes

3. **Timing Dependencies**
   - Envelope followers with buffer-size-dependent time constants
   - LFO phases not properly tracked across blocks

4. **Optimization Artifacts**
   - SIMD operations with alignment assumptions
   - Vectorized code that depends on specific block sizes

## Integration with CI/CD

This test suite can be integrated into continuous integration:

```bash
# Add to CI pipeline
./build_buffer_size_test.sh
cd build
./test_buffer_size_independence

# Check exit code (0 = all passed, 1 = failures)
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Buffer size independence test failed!"
    exit 1
fi
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to the test suite:

1. **Additional Test Signals**

   - Impulse responses
   - Frequency sweeps
   - Real-world audio content

2. **Extended Buffer Sizes**
   - Test extreme cases (8, 16, 4096, 8192 samples)
   - Non-power-of-2 sizes (48, 96, 192)

3. **Variable Buffer Sizes**
   - Test with changing buffer sizes mid-stream
   - Simulate DAW buffer size changes during playback

4. **Automated Regression Testing**
   - Baseline comparison against previous versions
   - Detect any degradation in buffer-size independence

5. **Performance Metrics**
