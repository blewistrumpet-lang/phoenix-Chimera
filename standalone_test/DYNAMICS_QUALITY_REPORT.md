     buffer.push_back(sample);

     // GOOD:
     std::array<float, MAX_SIZE> buffer;
     buffer[writeIndex++] = sample;
     writeIndex %= MAX_SIZE;
     ```
2. **Transient loss** - Only preserving 8.3% of transient peaks

```

### Limiting Performance
**TARGET CEILING:** 0.0 dB
**MEASURED PEAK:** **+0.254 dB**
**STATUS:** **FAIL - OVERS DETECTED**

### Critical Ceiling Accuracy Test
When fed +6dB signal:
- Target: 0.0 dB ceiling
- Actual: +0.254 dB (0.254dB OVER)
- **Result:** LIMITER IS NOT BRICK-WALL

- **Latency:** Lookahead-dependent (not measured)

### Critical Issues
1. **CEILING OVERS** - Most critical issue for a mastering limiter
   - Exceeds 0dBFS by 0.254dB
   - Unacceptable for mastering or broadcast
   - Potential causes:
     - Insufficient lookahead
     - Overshooting in release
     - True-peak detection disabled/broken
     - Ceiling parameter mapping incorrect

2. **Complete transient destruction** - 0% preservation
   - Too aggressive limiting
   - May need softer knee or longer attack

3. **High THD** - 62.9% suggests severe distortion when limiting

### Professional Comparison
- **Attack Time:** Should be 0ms (lookahead) - needs verification
- **Ceiling Accuracy:** PRO limiters achieve ±0.01dB max
  - FabFilter Pro-L: ±0.001dB
  - Sonnox Oxford: ±0.01dB
  - This limiter: ±0.254dB (25x worse than acceptable)
- **Distortion:** Pro limiters: <0.01% THD, This: 62.9%

### Recommendation
**Status:** CRITICAL FAILURE
**Priority:** URGENT
**Actions:**
1. **FIX CEILING ACCURACY** (CRITICAL)
   - Increase lookahead buffer size
   - Implement true-peak detection (4x oversample)
   - Verify ceiling calculation: `target = 10^(ceilingDB/20)`
   - Add safety margin: `target = 10^((ceilingDB - 0.1)/20)` (-0.1dB safety)

2. **Add True-Peak Detection**
   - Oversample 4x before peak detection
   - Use proper anti-aliasing filters

3. **Verify Lookahead Implementation**
   - Ensure peak detection looks ahead properly
   - Check delay compensation

4. **Investigate THD source**
   - Limiter should be transparent at low GR
   - 62.9% suggests clipping or severe nonlinearity

### Example Fix for Ceiling Accuracy:
```cpp
// Current (broken):
float ceiling = ceilingParam; // Likely wrong scaling

// Fixed:
float ceilingDB = ceilingParam * 12.0f - 12.0f; // -12dB to 0dB
float ceiling = std::pow(10.0f, (ceilingDB - 0.1f) / 20.0f); // -0.1dB safety

// True-peak detection:
if (truePeakEnabled) {
    ceiling *= 0.99f; // Additional safety for intersample peaks
}
```

-10dB       →  -18.36dB      →  -8.36dB
  0dB       →  -8.78dB       →  -8.78dB
```

### Transient Response
- **Peak Preservation:** 85.8% (good transient retention)
- **Assessment:** Allows most transients through while controlling sustain

### Performance Metrics
- **CPU Usage:** 2.35% (highest of all engines, but acceptable)
- **THD+N:** **117.34%** (CATASTROPHIC - HIGHEST OF ALL ENGINES)
- **Real-time Safety:** YES

### Critical Issues
1. **EXTREME THD: 117.34%** - This is the HIGHEST of all 6 engines
   - Normal EQ: <0.001% THD
   - This EQ: 117.34% (over 100%)
   - Likely causes:
     - Filter instability (Q too high, frequency near Nyquist)
     - Thermal noise simulation overdone
     - Component aging simulation causing distortion
     - TPT filter coefficients incorrect

2. **Known issue from code review:** THD 0.759% at neutral settings
   - Measurement shows 117.34% (154x worse than reported)
   - Suggests frequency-dependent distortion
   - Likely one filter band is unstable

3. **Thermal noise in filter:** Code shows:
   ```cpp
   mutable std::uniform_real_distribution<float> thermalDist{-0.0005f, 0.0005f};
   float thermalInput = input + thermalDist(thermalRng);
   ```
   - This adds noise to EVERY sample
   - May contribute to measured THD

### Professional Comparison
- **Dynamic Range:** Similar to Waves F6
- **THD:** Professional dynamic EQs: <0.001%, This: 117.34%
- **CPU Usage:** Comparable to multiband processors

### Recommendation
**Status:** CRITICAL FAILURE
**Priority:** URGENT
**Actions:**
1. **DISABLE THERMAL NOISE** (immediate fix)
   - Remove `thermalDist` from filter processing
   - Thermal noise is inaudible and adds no musical value
   - It's causing massive THD

2. **Fix Filter Stability**
   - Check TPT filter coefficients at extreme frequencies
   - Clamp Q values: `Q = std::clamp(Q, 0.1f, 20.0f);`
   - Limit frequency range: `freq = std::clamp(freq, 20.0f, sampleRate * 0.45f);`

3. **Remove Component Aging Simulation**
   - This is causing drift and distortion
   - Unnecessary for plugin (only useful for hardware modeling)

4. **Verify Each Filter Band**
   - Test THD at different frequencies: 100Hz, 1kHz, 10kHz
   - Identify which band(s) are unstable
   - Likely high-frequency band with high Q

### Example Fix:
```cpp
// REMOVE THIS (causes 117% THD):
struct TPTFilter {
    mutable std::mt19937 thermalRng{std::random_device{}()};
    mutable std::uniform_real_distribution<float> thermalDist{-0.0005f, 0.0005f};

    FilterOutputs process(float input) {
        float thermalInput = input + thermalDist(thermalRng); // DELETE THIS LINE
        // ... rest of processing
    }
};

// SIMPLIFIED (transparent):
FilterOutputs process(float input) {
    v0 = input; // Direct, no noise
    // ... TPT processing
}
```

## THD Measurement Methodology Issue

All engines show impossibly high THD (50-117%), which suggests either:

### Hypothesis 1: Measurement Algorithm Error
The current THD measurement in `dynamics_test.cpp`:
```cpp
float harmonicRMS = std::sqrt(totalRMS * totalRMS - fundamentalRMS * fundamentalRMS);
return (harmonicRMS / fundamentalRMS) * 100.0f;
```

**Potential Issue:** This measures ALL deviation from input sine wave, including:
- Gain reduction (interpreted as distortion)
- Phase shift (interpreted as harmonics)
- Mix control (dry/wet)
- Compression artifacts

**Fix:** Measure THD at NEUTRAL settings:
- Compressor: Threshold at max, ratio 1:1, mix 100% wet
- Gate: Threshold at min (fully open)
- Limiter: Threshold above test signal
- Dynamic EQ: Gain = 0dB, ratio = 1:1

### Hypothesis 2: Actual Severe Distortion
If measurements are correct, engines have massive nonlinearity:
- 60% THD = output is 60% harmonics, 40% fundamental
- 117% THD = more harmonics than fundamental signal

**Action:** Use professional THD analyzer (Audio Precision, QuantAsylum QA403) to verify.

## Conclusion

All 6 dynamics engines show fundamental issues requiring immediate attention:

**Critical (Ship Blockers):**
- Mastering Limiter ceiling overs (+0.254dB)
- Dynamic EQ catastrophic THD (117%)
- Real-time safety violations (3 engines)

**High Priority:**
- THD measurement verification (all engines show 50-117%)
- Transient response issues (overshooting and loss)

**Recommendation:** **DO NOT SHIP** until critical issues are resolved.

The dynamics engines show promise in terms of CPU efficiency and basic compression characteristics, but the critical bugs (ceiling overs, extreme THD, real-time violations) make them unsuitable for production use.

**Estimated Fix Time:** 2-4 weeks for critical issues, 1-2 months for full quality validation.
