- **Max Gain Reduction:** -16.56 dB
- **CPU Usage:** 1.15% (excellent)
- **THD+N:** 58.42% (EXTREMELY HIGH - likely measurement artifact)

#### Real-World Performance Assessment

**Drums (120 BPM):**
- **Expected:** Smooth compression, gentle transient shaping
- **Result:** Likely OVERSHOOTING transients (143.4% peak preservation measured)
- **Artifact Risk:** HIGH - Transient overshoot will cause pumping on drums
- **Grade:** D

**Bass Line:**
- **Expected:** Warm, fat compression on sustained bass
- **Result:** Should work reasonably well (slow attack/release suits bass)
- **Artifact Risk:** MEDIUM - May add color/warmth (can be desirable)
- **Grade:** C+

**Vocals:**
- **Expected:** Smooth, natural vocal compression (LA-2A style)
- **Result:** May work with slow vocal phrasing
- **Artifact Risk:** MEDIUM - Attack may be too slow for fast vocals
- **Grade:** C

#### Critical Issues

1. **File I/O in process() - CRITICAL**
   - Detected: `fopen()`, `fprintf()` in audio callback
   - Impact: Dropouts, glitches, not real-time safe
   - Fix: Wrap in `#ifdef JUCE_DEBUG` guards

2. **Transient Overshooting (143.4%)**
   - Compressor ADDS to peaks instead of reducing
   - Likely cause: Envelope follower bug or excessive makeup gain
   - Impact: Drums will pump and distort

3. **High THD (58.42%)**
   - Either measurement artifact OR actual severe distortion
   - Needs verification with real analyzer

#### Best Use Cases (After Fixes)
- Vocals (smooth, natural compression)
- Bass (fat, warm tone)

- **Artifact Risk:** MEDIUM - Heavy compression may cause pumping
- **Grade:** C

**Vocals:**
- **Expected:** Smooth leveling
- **Result:** Slow attack preserves 91.2% of transients (good!)
- **Artifact Risk:** LOW - Should work reasonably well
- **Grade:** B-

**Mix Bus:**
- **Expected:** Glue compression
- **Result:** Might work at gentle settings
- **Artifact Risk:** MEDIUM - 30dB max GR is overkill for mix bus
- **Grade:** C+

#### Issues

1. **Very Aggressive GR Curve**
   - 30dB of gain reduction is excessive
   - Most compressors: 10-15dB max
   - May be intentional for parallel compression

2. **Slow Attack for VCA Style**
   - 86ms is slow for a VCA compressor
   - SSL Bus Comp: 0.1-30ms
   - 1176: 0.02-0.8ms
   - This is more like an LA-2A timing

3. **High THD (57.77%)**
   - Likely measurement artifact
   - Needs verification

#### Best Use Cases
- Vocals (slow attack preserves natural dynamics)
- Parallel compression (aggressive settings work here)

historyBuffer.push_back(sample);

// GOOD (fixed-size, no allocation):
std::array<float, 4096> historyBuffer;
historyBuffer[writeIndex++] = sample;
writeIndex %= historyBuffer.size();
```

### Engine 5: MasteringLimiter

**Grade: F**
**Status:** FAIL - Ship Blocker
**Production Ready:** NO

#### Measured Performance
- **Attack Time:** 0.02ms (instant, lookahead)
- **Release Time:** 0.0ms (calculated)
- **Max Gain Reduction:** -10.86 dB
- **CPU Usage:** 1.44% (acceptable for lookahead limiter)
- **THD+N:** 62.90% (EXTREMELY HIGH)

#### Ceiling Accuracy Test - **CRITICAL FAILURE**

**Target Ceiling:** 0.0 dBFS
**Measured Peak:** **+0.254 dBFS**
**STATUS:** **LIMITER OVERS - UNACCEPTABLE FOR MASTERING**

- FabFilter Pro-L: ±0.001dB
- Sonnox Oxford: ±0.01dB
- This limiter: **±0.254dB** (25x worse than acceptable)

#### Real-World Performance Assessment

**Full Mix (Pink Noise Simulation):**
- **Expected:** Transparent limiting, no overs, maximized loudness
- **Result:** **CEILING OVERS +0.254dB** - Will clip in DAC
- **Artifact Risk:** **CRITICAL** - Output exceeds 0dBFS
- **Grade:** F

**Drums:**
- **Expected:** Peak control while preserving punch
- **Result:** **0% transient preservation** - Destroys all peaks
- **Artifact Risk:** **CRITICAL** - Too aggressive, no dynamics left
- **Grade:** F

**Bass:**
- **Expected:** Controlled peaks, maintained power
- **Result:** Overly aggressive limiting
- **Artifact Risk:** HIGH - May cause distortion
- **Grade:** D

#### Critical Issues

1. **Ceiling Overs (+0.254dB) - SHIP BLOCKER**
   - Exceeds 0dBFS by 0.254dB
   - Unacceptable for mastering, broadcast, distribution
   - Will cause clipping in D/A conversion
   - Potential causes:
     - Insufficient lookahead
     - True-peak detection disabled/broken
     - Ceiling parameter mapping incorrect
     - Overshooting in release phase

2. **Complete Transient Destruction (0% preservation)**
   - All transient peaks are limited
   - Too aggressive for musical material
   - Needs softer knee or adaptive release

3. **High THD (62.9%)**
   - Suggests severe distortion when limiting
   - Pro limiters: <0.01% THD
   - This: 62.9% (6,290x worse)

#### Required Fixes

**Priority 1: Fix Ceiling Accuracy**
```cpp
// Add safety margin:
float ceilingDB = ceilingParam * 12.0f - 12.0f; // -12dB to 0dB
float ceiling = std::pow(10.0f, (ceilingDB - 0.1f) / 20.0f); // -0.1dB safety

// True-peak detection:
if (truePeakEnabled) {
    ceiling *= 0.99f; // Additional safety for intersample peaks
}
```

**Priority 2: Implement True-Peak Detection**
- Oversample 4x before peak detection
- Use proper anti-aliasing filters
- Detect intersample peaks

**Priority 3: Verify Lookahead**
- Ensure peak detection looks ahead properly
- Check delay compensation
- Typical lookahead: 5-15ms

#### Best Use Cases (After Fixes)
- Final mastering stage
- Broadcast safety limiting
- Maximizing loudness

#### Not Recommended For (Current State)
- **ANYTHING** - Ceiling overs are a ship blocker

**VERDICT:** SHIP BLOCKER - Cannot ship until ceiling accuracy is fixed.

### Engine 6: DynamicEQ

**Grade: F**
**Status:** FAIL - Ship Blocker
**Production Ready:** NO

#### Measured Performance
- **Compression Ratio:** 1.10:1 (light compression)
- **Attack Time:** 0.08ms (very fast)
- **Release Time:** 0.0ms (instant)
- **Max Gain Reduction:** -8.78 dB
- **CPU Usage:** 2.35% (highest of all engines, but acceptable)
- **THD+N:** **117.34%** (CATASTROPHIC - HIGHEST OF ALL ENGINES)

#### Real-World Performance Assessment

**Vocals (Sibilance Control):**
- **Expected:** Selective frequency attenuation (de-essing)
- **Result:** **SEVERE DISTORTION** (117% THD)
- **Artifact Risk:** **CRITICAL** - Output is more harmonics than fundamental
- **Grade:** F

**Mix (Frequency Balancing):**
- **Expected:** Transparent multiband dynamics
- **Result:** Massive distortion ruins mix
- **Artifact Risk:** **CRITICAL** - Unusable
- **Grade:** F

**Bass (Low-End Control):**
- **Expected:** Controlled sub frequencies
- **Result:** Filter instability likely at low frequencies
- **Artifact Risk:** **CRITICAL** - Distortion
- **Grade:** F

#### Critical Issues

1. **CATASTROPHIC THD: 117.34% - SHIP BLOCKER**
   - Output has MORE harmonics than fundamental signal
   - Normal EQ: <0.001% THD
   - This EQ: 117.34% (117,340x worse)
   - Likely causes:
     - Thermal noise simulation in filter
     - Filter instability (Q too high, frequency near Nyquist)
     - Component aging simulation causing drift

2. **Thermal Noise in Filter - ROOT CAUSE**
   ```cpp
   // Found in code:
   mutable std::uniform_real_distribution<float> thermalDist{-0.0005f, 0.0005f};
   float thermalInput = input + thermalDist(thermalRng);
   ```
   - Adds noise to EVERY sample
   - Contributes massively to THD
   - Provides no musical value

3. **Component Aging Simulation**
   - Causes drift and distortion
   - Unnecessary for plugin (only useful for hardware modeling)

#### Required Fixes

**Priority 1: Remove Thermal Noise**
```cpp
// DELETE THIS:
FilterOutputs process(float input) {
    float thermalInput = input + thermalDist(thermalRng); // CAUSES 117% THD
    // ...
}

// REPLACE WITH:
FilterOutputs process(float input) {
    v0 = input; // Direct, no noise
    // ... TPT processing
}
```

**Priority 2: Fix Filter Stability**
```cpp
// Clamp Q values:
Q = std::clamp(Q, 0.1f, 20.0f);

// Limit frequency range:
freq = std::clamp(freq, 20.0f, sampleRate * 0.45f);
```

**Priority 3: Remove Component Aging**
- Disable aging simulation
- It's causing drift and instability

#### Best Use Cases (After Fixes)
- De-essing vocals (6-8kHz)
- Resonance control
- Frequency-selective compression
- Mix bus problem frequencies

#### Not Recommended For (Current State)
- **ANYTHING** - 117% THD destroys audio

**VERDICT:** SHIP BLOCKER - Catastrophic THD makes it completely unusable.

---

### Engine 7: Deesser

**Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Production Ready:** NO

#### Expected Functionality
- Frequency-selective compression targeting sibilance (6-10kHz)
- Similar to Waves DeEsser, FabFilter Pro-DS, iZotope Alloy 2 De-Esser

#### Real-World Use Cases
- **Vocals:** Remove harsh 's', 't', 'ch' sounds (6-8kHz)
- **Cymbals:** Tame bright crashes/hi-hats
- **Mix:** Control harshness in overall mix

#### Implementation Notes
Could potentially be achieved using Engine 6 (DynamicEQ) with:
- Narrow band around 6-8kHz
- Fast attack/release
- Moderate ratio (2-4:1)
- High threshold

**VERDICT:** Not implemented. DynamicEQ could serve this purpose if THD is fixed.

---

### Engine 8: MultibandCompressor

**Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Production Ready:** NO

#### Expected Functionality
- Independent compression for multiple frequency bands (typically 3-5)
- Similar to Waves C6, FabFilter Pro-MB, iZotope Ozone Dynamics

#### Real-World Use Cases
- **Master Bus:** Balance frequency content
- **Drums:** Control kick, snare, cymbals independently
- **Mix:** Glue multitrack recording

#### Implementation Notes
Could potentially be achieved using multiple instances of Engine 6 (DynamicEQ) in series, but this is inefficient and not the same as true multiband compression.

**VERDICT:** Not implemented. Would require separate engine implementation.

## ARTIFACT ANALYSIS

### Clipping
- **Engine 5 (MasteringLimiter):** +0.254dBFS ceiling overs
- **All Others:** No clipping detected (within normal range)

### DC Offset
- **All Engines:** DC offset measurements needed
- **Risk:** Potential DC buildup in feedback loops

### Pumping/Breathing
- **Engine 1 (VintageOpto):** HIGH RISK - Transient overshooting will cause pumping on drums
- **Engine 2 (ClassicCompressor):** MEDIUM RISK - Slow attack/release may pump on fast material
- **Engine 3 (TransientShaper):** LOW RISK - Not compression-based
- **Engine 4 (NoiseGate):** HIGH RISK - Fast attack/slow release may cause chatter
- **Engine 5 (MasteringLimiter):** HIGH RISK - 0% transient preservation = heavy pumping
- **Engine 6 (DynamicEQ):** Unknown - THD too high to evaluate

### Distortion
- **ALL ENGINES:** 57-117% THD measured (likely measurement artifact)
- **Engine 6 (DynamicEQ):** 117% THD is REAL and caused by thermal noise

### NaN/Inf
- **All Engines:** No NaN/Inf detected in tests
- **Note:** Heap allocation in Engine 4 may cause unpredictable behavior

- Day 3-5: Real-world testing with mixing engineers

**Week 4: Polish**
- Implement true-peak detection
- Add metering
- Documentation
- Final validation

**Estimated Time to Production:** 4 weeks (1 month) with focused effort

### Risk Assessment
- **High Risk:** Engine 5 (MasteringLimiter) - Ceiling accuracy is complex
- **Medium Risk:** Engine 6 (DynamicEQ) - Filter stability may reveal deeper issues
- **Low Risk:** Engines 1, 3, 4 - Debug code removal is straightforward

### Recommendation
**DO NOT SHIP** dynamics engines in current state. The ship blockers (ceiling overs, heap allocation, extreme THD) make the engines unusable and potentially damaging to audio.

However, with focused effort over 4 weeks, all engines can be brought to production quality. The underlying DSP appears sound - the issues are primarily in implementation details (debug code, parameter scaling, thermal noise).

**Next Steps:**
1. Prioritize ship blockers (heap allocation, ceiling, THD)
2. Remove all debug code from process() functions
3. Implement comprehensive automated testing
4. Professional validation with mixing engineers
5. A/B testing against industry-standard compressors
