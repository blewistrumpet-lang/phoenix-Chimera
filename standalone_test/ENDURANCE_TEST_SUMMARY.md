| Convolution Reverb (39) | 64 KB | 11.2 MB/min | üü° HIGH |
| Shimmer Reverb (40) | 32 KB | 6.1 MB/min | üü° MODERATE |
| Tape Echo (34) | 109 KB | 3.9 MB/min | üü° MODERATE |
| Digital Delay (35) | 78 KB | 2.0 MB/min | üü° LOW |
| Bucket Brigade (37) | 16 KB | 1.4 MB/min | üü° LOW |
| Buffer Repeat (38) | 32 KB | 1.4 MB/min | üü° LOW |
| Magnetic Drum (36) | 31 KB | 0.47 MB/min | ‚úÖ ACCEPTABLE |
| Spring Reverb (42) | 0 KB | 0 MB/min | ‚úÖ NONE |
| Gated Reverb (43) | 0 KB | 0 MB/min | ‚úÖ NONE |

**Root Causes:**
- **Plate Reverb:** Likely re-creating IR buffers during parameter updates without releasing old buffers
- **Convolution Reverb:** IR buffer management issues during parameter changes
- **Shimmer Reverb:** Pitch shifter buffer accumulation
- **Delay engines:** Circular buffer allocations not being freed

### Performance Degradation Analysis

| Engine | Avg Block Time | Max Block Time | Degradation | Severity |
|--------|----------------|----------------|-------------|----------|
| **Plate Reverb (41)** | 123 Œºs | 6031 Œºs | 6007% | üî¥ EXTREME |
| **Shimmer Reverb (40)** | 8 Œºs | 89 Œºs | 1371% | üî¥ HIGH |
| **Magnetic Drum (36)** | 139 Œºs | 1360 Œºs | 1121% | üî¥ HIGH |
| Spring Reverb (42) | 10 Œºs | 93 Œºs | 1029% | üü° HIGH |
| Convolution Reverb (39) | 8 Œºs | 47 Œºs | 589% | üü° MODERATE |
| Bucket Brigade (37) | 20 Œºs | 108 Œºs | 584% | üü° MODERATE |
| Gated Reverb (43) | 9 Œºs | 47 Œºs | 564% | üü° MODERATE |
| Tape Echo (34) | 57 Œºs | 214 Œºs | 373% | üü° MODERATE |
| Buffer Repeat (38) | 44 Œºs | 129 Œºs | 264% | üü° MODERATE |
| Digital Delay (35) | 78 Œºs | 182 Œºs | 191% | üü° LOW |

**Note:** All engines show acceptable real-time ratios (< 0.013x), meaning they can process audio faster than real-time. However, the degradation indicates potential issues with:
- Cache invalidation patterns
- Memory fragmentation
- Accumulating state
- Algorithmic complexity growth

**Root Causes:**
- **Plate Reverb:** Likely triggering expensive IR reload/recalculation on every block
- **Magnetic Drum Echo:** Possible accumulating filter state or buffer management issues
- **All engines:** Max block time much higher than average suggests periodic expensive operations

### Audio Quality Issues

| Engine | NaN/Inf | DC Offset | Clipping | Verdict |
|--------|---------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Shimmer Reverb (40) | ‚úì | **98%** | **100%** | üî¥ CRITICAL |
| Digital Delay (35) | ‚úì | **24%** | ‚úì | üü° MODERATE |
| Buffer Repeat (38) | ‚úì | 7% | ‚úì | üü° LOW |
| Tape Echo (34) | ‚úì | 1% | ‚úì | üü° LOW |
| All others | ‚úì | ‚úì | ‚úì | ‚úÖ PASS |

**Root Causes:**
- **Shimmer Reverb:** Pitch shifting algorithm causing constant DC offset and amplitude buildup
- **Digital Delay:** Feedback path not properly AC-coupled
- **Other delays:** Minor DC coupling in feedback loops

### Performance Degradation Investigation

**Common issue across ALL engines:** Performance degrades by 190-6000% over 5 minutes.

3. Heap fragmentation from repeated allocations
4. Virtual memory page thrashing

**Recommended investigation:**
- Profile with Instruments (Time Profiler + Allocations)
