### Engines Fixed Today (August 17):
1. **DynamicEQ** - Thread safety fixes
2. **ResonantChorus** - Complete implementation from scratch
3. **BufferRepeat** - Thread safety and mode restoration
4. **PlateReverb** - Reverb tail generation fixed
5. **SpringReverb_Platinum** - Denormal protection added
6. **ConvolutionReverb** - Mix parameter mapping fixed
7. **ShimmerReverb** - Tail generation verified
8. **SpectralGate** - Complete STFT implementation from scratch

### Engines Still Needing Fixes (12):

#### Numerical Issues (5):
1. **VintageOptoCompressor_Platinum** - Division by zero
2. **KStyleOverdrive** - Uninitialized variables causing NaN
3. **DimensionExpander** - NaN in spatial calculations
4. **SpringReverb_Platinum** - Square root of negative (may be fixed with DenormalGuard)
5. **PhaseAlign_Platinum** - Infinity in phase calculations

#### Hanging/Infinite Loops (7):
1. **SpectralFreeze** - STFT processing deadlock
2. **GranularCloud** - Grain scheduling infinite loop
3. **ChaosGenerator** - Lorenz attractor overflow
4. **FeedbackNetwork** - Unstable feedback causing runaway
5. **GainUtility** - Simple gain but hanging (likely trivial fix)
6. **MonoMaker** - Channel summing issue causing hang
7. **ChaosGenerator** (duplicate entry in original data)

### Notes:
- All reverbs now generate proper tails after today's fixes
- GatedReverb cutting tail when gate closes is **expected behavior**
- Spatial and Utility categories have the most issues (complex algorithms)
- Most issues are in advanced/experimental engines
- Core bread-and-butter effects (EQ, Compression, Delays, Reverbs) are solid
