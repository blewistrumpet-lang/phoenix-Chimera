# PROJECT MANAGER STATUS REPORT - Chimera Phoenix v3.0
*Date: 2025-09-02*
*Role: Project Manager Assessment*

## Project Overview
**Chimera Phoenix** is a JUCE-based audio plugin (VST3/AU) featuring 57+ DSP engines organized into categories. The plugin allows users to chain multiple effects in slots for complex audio processing.

## Project Timeline & Key Milestones

### Phase 1: Initial Development (Pre-August 2025)
- Built 57 DSP engines across multiple categories
- Established EngineBase interface architecture
- Created plugin framework with JUCE

### Phase 2: Major Architecture Overhaul (August 17-19, 2025)
From git history:
- `8973f2f`: Major Architecture Overhaul - Engine System Integrity
- `fabfff0`: Phase 3 Complete - All 57 engines migrated to DspEngineUtilities
- `9e94948`: Achievement: 100% Engine Success Rate
- Created comprehensive testing framework

### Phase 3: Engine Fixes (August 20-23, 2025)
From git history:
- `8e5d46b`: Implement studio-quality PitchShifter with Laroche-Dolson phase vocoder
- `91792c7`: Fix volume drop and improve timbre preservation in PitchShifter  
- `31dccaf`: Fix PhasedVocoder and complete all Pitch/Formant engines
- Declared all engines "fully functional" in ENGINE_STATUS.md

### Phase 4: Current Issues Discovery (August 24-Present)
- User reports multiple engines not working as expected
- Discovery that Signalsmith library has unusable latency
- Conflicting test results vs user experience

## Current System State (FACTUAL)

### What's ACTUALLY Working:
Based on test_all_engines_status output:
1. **IntelligentHarmonizer**: ✅ Outputs audio (but only in low-latency mode, not using Signalsmith)
2. **ShimmerReverb**: ✅ Outputs audio (but weak reverb, no shimmer effect)
3. **Dynamics/Compression**: Reportedly working (not recently tested)
4. **Distortion Engines**: Reportedly working (not recently tested)

### What's BROKEN:
Based on test_all_engines_status output:
1. **PitchShifter**: ❌ Not outputting audio (8/10 silent blocks)
2. **PhasedVocoder**: ⚠️ Intermittent output (8/10 silent blocks)
3. **Other Pitch Engines**: Unknown status (DetuneDoubler, FormantFilter, VocalFormantFilter)

### Root Cause Analysis:

#### 1. Signalsmith Library Issue
**Documentation**: From ARCHITECTURE_ASSESSMENT.md and conversation history
- Library was integrated for pitch shifting
- Has extremely high latency (thousands of samples)
- Makes it unusable for real-time processing
- Affects: PitchShifter, IntelligentHarmonizer (high-quality mode), ShimmerReverb (shimmer effect)

#### 2. Parameter Design Issues
**Documentation**: From ShimmerReverb.cpp analysis
- Reverb feedback capped at 0.55 (very short decay)
- No reverb time parameter
- Results in weak/short reverb tail

#### 3. Inconsistent Implementation
- IntelligentHarmonizer has fallback (low-latency mode) - WORKS
- PitchShifter has no fallback - BROKEN
- ShimmerReverb has no fallback - PARTIALLY BROKEN

## Conflicting Information

### Documentation Says "Working" But Tests Show "Broken":
- ENGINE_STATUS.md (Aug 23): "All engine categories are now fully functional!"
- Test output (Today): PitchShifter not outputting audio
- Git commit 31dccaf: "Fix PhasedVocoder and complete all Pitch/Formant engines"
- Test output (Today): PhasedVocoder intermittent

### User Experience vs Test Results:
- User: "PitchShifter IS shifting pitch"
- Test: Shows no output
- Possible explanation: Extreme latency makes it seem broken in tests but works with longer audio

## Technical Debt & Architecture Issues

1. **No Abstraction Layer**: Direct library dependencies without interfaces
2. **No Latency Management**: No system for handling/reporting latency
3. **Inconsistent Fallbacks**: Some engines have backups, others don't
4. **Parameter Ranges**: Hard-coded limits preventing proper functionality

## What We've Attempted Today

1. Created SimplePitchShift.h - zero-latency alternative
2. Started replacing Signalsmith in PitchShifter
3. Got stuck in implementation details
4. Lost track of bigger picture

## CRITICAL PATH FORWARD

### Option A: Quick Fix (1-2 days)
1. Implement simple pitch shift for all affected engines
2. Increase ShimmerReverb feedback range
3. Ship with "good enough" quality

### Option B: Proper Fix (1 week)
1. Create pitch shift abstraction layer
2. Implement multiple backends (simple, Signalsmith with latency compensation, etc.)
3. Add latency reporting to EngineBase
4. Properly test all engines

### Option C: Strategic Pause (2 weeks)
1. Full architecture review
2. Establish quality standards
3. Implement comprehensive testing
4. Fix systematically

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk:
- Continuing without clear architecture plan
- Making changes without understanding impact
- Conflicting documentation vs reality

### Medium Risk:
- Simple implementations may not meet quality standards
- Users expecting "studio quality" based on commits

### Low Risk:
- Core framework (EngineBase, parameter system) is solid
- Some engines genuinely working well

## Recommendation

**STOP**: Making incremental fixes without understanding system state

**ASSESS**: Run comprehensive tests on ALL 57 engines to establish ground truth

**DECIDE**: Whether to do quick fixes or proper architecture work

**DOCUMENT**: Real state vs aspirational state

**PROCEED**: With clear plan and success metrics

## Questions Requiring Answers

1. What quality level is acceptable for v3.0 release?
2. Is latency compensation possible/worth implementing?
3. Should we find alternative to Signalsmith or remove pitch shifting features?
4. What's the timeline/deadline for this project?
5. Who are the users and what are their expectations?

---

## Summary

The project has strong foundations but is currently in a **confused state** where:
- Documentation claims everything works
- Tests show multiple broken engines  
- User experience differs from test results
- Root cause (Signalsmith latency) is identified but not fully addressed

We need to **establish ground truth** about what actually works, then make a strategic decision about how to proceed.
