THD ANALYSIS (CATASTROPHIC):
=============================
• AnalogPhaser: 190.93% ❌
• ClassicTremolo: 132.01% ❌
• ResonantChorus: 104.74% ❌
• RotarySpeaker: 104.21% ❌
• HarmonicTremolo: 73.72% ❌
• StereoChorus: 65.52% ❌

Average THD: 111.86% (Should be <1% for production)

MODULATION EFFECTIVENESS:
=========================
Engines with working modulation:
• StereoChorus: 33.48 Hz, 53.42% depth ✓
• HarmonicTremolo: 10.42 Hz, 30.52% depth ✓
• ClassicTremolo: 0 Hz, 33.16% depth (partial)

Engines with NO modulation:
• AnalogPhaser: 0 Hz, 0.70% depth ✗
• ResonantChorus: 0 Hz, 16.67% depth ✗
• RotarySpeaker: 0 Hz, 8.77% depth ✗

RECOMMENDATIONS:
================

COMPLETE REWRITES NEEDED:
1. AnalogPhaser - Totally non-functional
2. ResonantChorus - Mostly broken
3. RotarySpeaker - Doesn't simulate rotary speaker

MAJOR FIXES NEEDED:
4. ClassicTremolo - Fix extreme THD
5. HarmonicTremolo - Fix THD and parameters
6. StereoChorus - Fix THD and artifacts

SUCCESS RATE:
=============
• 0% (0/6) Production Ready
• 0% (0/6) Partially Working
• 100% (6/6) Require complete rewrites or major fixes

COMPARISON WITH OTHER CATEGORIES:
==================================
• Pitch/Frequency: Mixed results (some A grades)
• Dynamics: 33% production ready
• Modulation: 0% production ready ❌

CONCLUSION:
===========
The modulation category is in CRITICAL condition. Every single engine failed
testing with 0/100 scores. The primary issues are:

1. Extreme harmonic distortion (65-190% THD)
2. Non-functional parameters (50% don't work)
3. Missing modulation characteristics
4. Poor implementation quality

This is the WORST performing category tested so far. Unlike dynamics which had
some excellent engines (NoiseGate A+), modulation has ZERO usable engines.

Priority should be given to completely rewriting these engines from scratch
with proper DSP algorithms, as fixing the current implementations may be
more work than starting over.

The fact that AnalogPhaser has 0/8 working parameters and 190% THD suggests
these may be placeholder or severely broken implementations that were never
properly tested.
