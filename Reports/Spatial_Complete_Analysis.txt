================================================================================

Date: August 21, 2025
Framework: Comprehensive Spatial Analyzer v1.0
Test Coverage: 4 engines tested with full parameter sweeps and spectral analysis

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
=================
Complete failure of all spatial processing engines. No engines are production-ready.
All 4 engines show non-functional parameters with no actual spatial processing.

CATEGORY STATISTICS
====================
Total Engines Tested: 4
Production Ready: 0 (0%)
Needs Minor Fixes: 0 (0%)
Needs Major Work: 0 (0%)
Complete Rewrites: 4 (100%)

Working Parameters: 0/32 (0%)
Average Quality Score: 42.79/100
Average THD: 0.89%

INDIVIDUAL ENGINE RESULTS
=========================

1. StereoImager
---------------
Grade: D (38.81/100)
Working Parameters: 0/8
THD: 0.54%
Phase Correlation: -0.45 (Good stereo)
Mono Compatibility: 14.34%

Issues:
- NO parameters have any effect on the signal
- Width controls (Width, Low/Mid/High Width) don't change stereo width
- Low mono compatibility indicates severe phase issues
- Processing creates phantom width without parameter control

Verdict: Complete rewrite needed - engine produces output but ignores all parameters


2. StereoWidener
----------------
Grade: D (37.55/100)
Working Parameters: 0/8
THD: 1.23%
Phase Correlation: 0.58 (Narrow)
Mono Compatibility: 49.46%

Issues:
- All parameters completely non-functional
- Haas delay and Bass Mono features don't work
- No width enhancement despite engine name
- Higher THD than expected for spatial processor

Verdict: Complete rewrite needed - fundamental processing broken


3. DimensionExpander
--------------------
Grade: D (59.63/100)
Working Parameters: 0/8
THD: 0.18%
Phase Correlation: 0.61 (Narrow)
Mono Compatibility: 60.18%

Issues:
- All 8 parameters non-functional
- No actual dimension expansion occurring
- Width/Depth/Crossfeed/Ambience all broken
- Best mono compatibility but still produces narrow stereo

Verdict: Complete rewrite needed - no spatial processing implemented


4. MidSideProcessor_Platinum
-----------------------------
Grade: D (36.16/100)
Working Parameters: 0/8
THD: 1.62%
Phase Correlation: -0.40 (Good stereo)
Mono Compatibility: 0%

Issues:
- Complete mono incompatibility (0%)
- Mid/Side gain controls non-functional
- Bass Mono feature doesn't work
- Despite "Platinum" label, worst performer in category
- M/S ratio of 2.36 indicates severe processing errors

Verdict: Complete rewrite needed - critical M/S processing failures


CRITICAL FINDINGS
=================

1. Parameter Failure Pattern:
   - 100% of parameters across all engines are non-functional
   - Indicates systematic issue with parameter mapping or processing
   - updateParameters() likely not connected to DSP

2. Stereo Processing Issues:
   - None of the engines properly manipulate stereo width
   - Phase correlation values indicate processing occurs but uncontrolled
   - Mono compatibility ranges from 0% to 60% (should be >80%)

3. Implementation Problems:
   - Engines produce some output but ignore control parameters
   - Processing appears hardcoded or using default values
   - No dynamic response to parameter changes

4. Quality Concerns:
   - MidSideProcessor_Platinum has 0% mono compatibility (broadcast fail)
   - StereoImager creates phantom width without control
   - DimensionExpander doesn't expand anything


RECOMMENDATIONS
===============

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. Remove all spatial engines from production builds
2. Investigate parameter update system - appears completely broken
3. Review M/S encoding/decoding math in MidSideProcessor

REQUIRED FIXES:
1. Complete rewrite of all 4 engines
2. Implement proper M/S matrix processing
3. Add Haas effect and crossfeed algorithms
4. Ensure >80% mono compatibility for all engines
5. Implement parameter smoothing for click-free operation

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
1. Verify each parameter affects processing
2. Test mono compatibility for broadcast standards
3. Measure actual stereo width enhancement
4. Check phase coherence across frequency spectrum


CONCLUSION
==========
The Spatial category represents a complete failure with 0% functional engines.
All engines require complete rewrites from scratch. The parameter system
appears fundamentally broken across all spatial processors.

Priority: CRITICAL - Spatial processing is essential for modern production
Estimated effort: 2-3 weeks for complete category rewrite
