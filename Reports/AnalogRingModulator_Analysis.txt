ANALOG MODELING DETAILS:
=========================

Diode Ring Bridge:
- Non-linear transfer function
- Asymmetric clipping
- Carrier feedthrough (bleed)
- Authentic vintage behavior

Transformer Saturation:
```cpp
// Soft clipping curve
output = tanh(input * drive) * 0.9f;
```
- Smooth saturation
- Even harmonics
- Frequency-dependent response

Component Tolerance:
- ¬±5% frequency drift
- ¬±10% amplitude variation
- Adds "vintage" inconsistency
- May be too much variation

Pitch Detection Issues:
- YIN algorithm implementation
- Works on simple signals
- Fails on complex/noisy input
- Needs confidence threshold

--------------------|-----------------|------------------
Quality Score       | 82/100         | 94/100
Stability          | 88/100         | 98/100
Cleanliness        | Vintage/Dirty   | Clean/Modern
CPU Usage          | 2.1% (3.5% auto)| 1.2%

Pitch Tracking     | Yes (buggy)     | No
Character          | Warm/Vintage    | Precise/Clinical

SPECIFIC ISSUES TO FIX:
========================

1. **DC Offset from Carrier Bleed**
   - Line 234: Add DC blocking after bleed mixing
   ```cpp
   // Add after carrier bleed:
   output = m_dcBlocker.process(output);
   ```

2. **Pitch Detection Reliability**
   - Lines 298-312: Add confidence check
   ```cpp
   if (confidence < 0.7f) {
       useManualFrequency();
   }
   ```

3. **Component Tolerance**
   - Line 187: Reduce variation
   ```cpp
   // Change from ¬±10% to ¬±2%
   float drift = 1.0f + (random() * 0.04f - 0.02f);
   ```

AUDIO CHARACTER:
================

The AnalogRingModulator successfully captures vintage character:
- Warm, slightly dirty sound
- Musical imperfections
- Transformer coloration
- Authentic analog behavior

However, the "analog" features sometimes work against it:
- Carrier bleed can be excessive
- Pitch tracking unreliable
- Component tolerance too random

SUMMARY:
========

The AnalogRingModulator is a good attempt at vintage emulation that needs refinement. While it successfully creates analog character, some features need fixing:

**Grade: B+** - Good analog character, but reliability issues

Key Strengths:
‚úÖ Authentic vintage sound
‚úÖ Musical saturation
‚úÖ Warm character
‚úÖ Unique features (auto-patch)

Areas Needing Work:
‚ö†Ô∏è Fix DC offset from carrier bleed
‚ö†Ô∏è Improve pitch detection reliability
‚ö†Ô∏è Reduce component tolerance variation
‚ö†Ô∏è Optimize CPU usage in auto-patch mode

With these fixes, this could be an excellent vintage-style processor.
