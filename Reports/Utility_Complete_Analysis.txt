TECHNICAL ANALYSIS:
===================

Gain Analysis Summary:
• MidSideProcessor: Unity gain, no processing
• GainUtility: Unity gain, controls don't work
• MonoMaker: Unity gain, no mono processing
• PhaseAlign: +0.2dB gain with phase corruption
• SpectralFreeze: -0.11dB gain, minimal processing
• SpectralGate: -inf dB (SILENCE!)

Phase Analysis Summary:
• MidSideProcessor: 0° shift (correct for bypass)
• GainUtility: 0° shift (correct for bypass)
• MonoMaker: 0° shift (should have phase changes)
• PhaseAlign: 46.26° shift (uncontrolled!)
• SpectralFreeze: 0.0001° shift (negligible)
• SpectralGate: -5.8° shift (but output is silent)

THD Performance:
• All engines: <0.001% (because they do nothing)
• Only PhaseAlign shows measurable distortion

SNR Performance:
• Most engines: 190+ dB (perfect, but meaningless)
• PhaseAlign: 16 dB (TERRIBLE!)
• SpectralGate: Unmeasurable (silent output)

PARAMETER FUNCTIONALITY SUMMARY:
=================================
• ALL ENGINES: 0/8 parameters working (0%)
• Total across category: 0/48 parameters working (0%)

This is the WORST parameter functionality of any category!

CRITICAL FINDINGS:
==================

1. **100% PARAMETER FAILURE**: Not a single parameter works in any engine
2. **SpectralGate MUTES AUDIO**: Complete silence output is dangerous
3. **PhaseAlign CORRUPTS AUDIO**: Adds noise and unwanted phase shift
4. **No M/S Processing**: MidSideProcessor doesn't encode/decode
5. **No Gain Control**: GainUtility provides no gain adjustment
6. **No Spectral Processing**: Both spectral engines non-functional

COMPARISON WITH OTHER CATEGORIES:
==================================
• Pitch/Frequency: Mixed (some A grades)
• Dynamics: 33% production ready
• Modulation: 0% production ready
• Filter: 0% production ready
• Time-Based: 12.5% production ready
• Distortion: 0% production ready, 75% hang
• Utility: 0% production ready, 0% parameters work ❌❌❌

This ties with Distortion as the worst category!

SPECIFIC FAILURES:
==================

MidSideProcessor_Platinum:
• Should: Encode L/R to M/S, process, decode back
• Actually: Complete bypass, no encoding/decoding
• Missing: Matrix math, gain controls, width control

GainUtility_Platinum:
• Should: Provide gain staging for L/R/M/S
• Actually: No gain changes at all
• Missing: All gain functionality

MonoMaker_Platinum:
• Should: Sum to mono below frequency cutoff
• Actually: No mono summing at any frequency
• Missing: Crossover, phase alignment, mono sum

PhaseAlign_Platinum:
• Should: Align phase between channels/bands
• Actually: Adds random phase shift and noise
• Missing: Phase detection, correction algorithm

SpectralFreeze:
• Should: Freeze spectral content via FFT
• Actually: Minimal processing, no freezing
• Missing: FFT freeze, spectral hold, smear

SpectralGate_Platinum:
• Should: Gate frequency bands based on threshold
• Actually: Mutes everything to silence
• Missing: Spectral analysis, gating logic

IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:
======================
These engines appear to be:
1. Placeholder stubs with no DSP code
2. Copy-pasted templates with no implementation
3. Never tested even once
4. Missing all core algorithms

RECOMMENDATIONS:
================

IMMEDIATE CRITICAL FIXES:
1. Fix SpectralGate to stop muting audio (DANGEROUS!)
2. Fix PhaseAlign to stop corrupting audio
3. Implement basic gain in GainUtility
4. Add M/S matrix to MidSideProcessor

COMPLETE REWRITES NEEDED:
ALL engines need complete implementation from scratch:
1. MidSideProcessor: Add M/S encoding/decoding matrices
2. GainUtility: Implement gain staging
3. MonoMaker: Add crossover and mono summing
4. PhaseAlign: Implement phase detection/correction
5. SpectralFreeze: Add FFT-based freezing
6. SpectralGate: Implement spectral gating

SUCCESS METRICS:
================
• Production Ready: 0/6 (0%)
• Partially Working: 1/6 (17%) - SpectralFreeze barely
• Completely Broken: 5/6 (83%)
• Parameters Working: 0/48 (0%)

CONCLUSION:
===========
The Utility & Special category represents a complete implementation failure.
These are not "broken" engines - they are NON-EXISTENT engines with stub
interfaces. The complete absence of parameter functionality (0/48) indicates
these were never implemented at all.

Most concerning:
1. SpectralGate creates SILENCE - could ruin a mix
2. PhaseAlign CORRUPTS audio with noise
3. Basic utilities like Gain don't work
4. No M/S processing despite "Platinum" designation

These engines should be marked as "NOT IMPLEMENTED" rather than included
in the plugin. They provide no utility and some actively damage audio.

The name "Platinum" is particularly misleading as these engines don't even
reach "Alpha" quality. They are non-functional placeholders.

Priority: Either remove these engines entirely or implement them from scratch.
In their current state, they add no value and create confusion/frustration.
