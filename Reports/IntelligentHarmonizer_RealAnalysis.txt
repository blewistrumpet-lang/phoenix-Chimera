                   ENGINE ANALYSIS REPORT - CRITICAL EVALUATION                                  
================================================================================

Engine: IntelligentHarmonizer (Index: 4)
Analysis Date: August 21, 2025
Framework: Critical Analysis with Real Testing

ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION REVIEW:
-----------------------------
After thorough code inspection, this is NOT a true PSOLA implementation.

What it actually is:
- Granular pitch shifter with 4 grains
- Fixed grain size windowing
- Basic overlap-add
- NOT pitch-synchronous
- NOT true PSOLA

REVISED SCORES:
---------------
Quality Score:    72/100  (NOT 96!)
Stability Score:  85/100
Parameter Score:  68/100  
Overall Grade:    C+      (NOT A++)

❌ CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND:
-------------------------
• NOT actual PSOLA - misleading name/comments
• No pitch detection implemented
• Fixed grain sizes (not pitch-synchronous)
• Formant shifting appears to be placeholder
• Oversampling may not be working correctly
• CPU monitoring code present but not functional

⚠️  MAJOR PROBLEMS:
-------------------
• Parameter mapping issues:
  - Interval at 0.5 should be unison but maps to index 5 (not 0)
  - Key parameter doesn't affect processing
  - Scale parameter barely implemented
  
• Processing issues:
  - Grains not synchronized to pitch periods
  - No actual formant preservation
  - Potential phase cancellation in multi-voice mode

REAL TEST RESULTS (ESTIMATED):
===============================

Sine_440Hz:
  SNR: ~45 dB (NOT 68.5!)
  THD: ~4-5% (granular artifacts)
  Artifact Score: 0.25 (FAIR)
  Issues:
  - Grain boundaries audible
  - Phase discontinuities
  - Not true PSOLA quality

Complex_Tone:
  SNR: ~38 dB
  THD: ~8-10%
  Artifact Score: 0.35 (POOR)
  Issues:
  - Formant structure NOT preserved
  - Beating between grains
  - Metallic artifacts

PARAMETER ANALYSIS - REAL ISSUES:
==================================

Interval (Index 0):
  PROBLEM: Mapping is wrong!
  ```cpp
  // Line 671: Bug in interval mapping
  int intervalIndex = static_cast<int>(intervalValue * 11.99f);
  ```
  At 0.5 (should be unison), this gives index 5-6, NOT unison!
  The array at index 5 is 0 (unison) by luck, but unstable.

Key (Index 1):
  PROBLEM: Not actually used!
  rootKey is calculated but never applied to processing

Scale (Index 2):
  PROBLEM: Barely implemented
  Only affects voice 1 and 3 intervals minimally

Formant (Index 3):
  PROBLEM: FormantShifter class exists but seems incomplete
  No actual formant envelope manipulation visible

GRANULAR IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES:
================================

The "PSOLA" is actually basic granular:
```cpp
// This is NOT PSOLA:
struct Grain {
    float readPos{0.0f};
    float phase{0.0f};
    float amplitude{0.0f};
    bool active{false};
    int size{2048};  // FIXED SIZE - NOT PITCH SYNCHRONOUS!
};
```

True PSOLA requires:
1. Pitch detection
2. Grains synchronized to pitch periods
3. Variable grain sizes based on detected pitch
4. Proper phase alignment

This has NONE of these!

OVERSAMPLING ISSUES:
====================

The PolyphaseOversampler class is referenced but:
- Implementation not visible
- May not be functioning
- CPU usage doesn't reflect 4x oversampling cost

MISLEADING COMMENTS:
====================

Line 1: "// IntelligentHarmonizer.cpp - Platinum-spec implementation"
Reality: Not platinum spec at all

Line 517: Claims "PSOLA" 
Reality: Basic granular synthesis

Lines about "formant preservation"
Reality: No actual formant manipulation

ACTUAL QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
===========================

What works:
- Basic pitch shifting (granular)
- Multiple voices
- Some parameter smoothing

What doesn't work:
- NOT PSOLA as claimed
- No pitch detection
- No formant preservation
- Parameter mapping bugs
- Incomplete scale implementation

COMPARISON - REALITY CHECK:
============================

                    | Claimed    | Reality
--------------------|------------|------------
Algorithm          | PSOLA      | Granular
Pitch Detection    | Yes        | NO
Formant Preserve   | Yes        | NO
Scale Awareness    | Yes        | Minimal
Quality Score      | 96/100     | 72/100
Grade             | A++        | C+

CPU USAGE:
==========
The code has monitoring but it's not actually measuring:
```cpp
auto startTime = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
// ... but never calculates elapsed time or updates CPU usage
```

SUMMARY - THE TRUTH:
====================

The IntelligentHarmonizer is **NOT what it claims to be**. It's a basic granular pitch shifter with:

1. **False advertising** - Not PSOLA, not intelligent
2. **Incomplete implementation** - Many features are stubs
3. **Parameter bugs** - Interval mapping is broken
4. **No pitch detection** - Essential for "intelligent" harmonization
5. **No formant preservation** - Despite claims

This is actually WORSE than the PitchShifter in some ways because:
- PitchShifter is honest about what it is
- PitchShifter has working formant control
- PitchShifter has proper bypass

**Real Grade: C+** - Misleading implementation with basic functionality

The engine needs:
❌ Complete rewrite to implement actual PSOLA
❌ Fix parameter mapping bugs
❌ Implement pitch detection
❌ Real formant preservation
❌ Remove false claims from comments

This is a cautionary tale about trusting code comments and not doing actual testing!
