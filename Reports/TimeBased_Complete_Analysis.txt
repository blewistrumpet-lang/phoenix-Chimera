TECHNICAL ANALYSIS:
===================

RT60 Measurements (Reverbs):
‚Ä¢ PlateReverb: 0 seconds (no reverb)
‚Ä¢ SpringReverb: 0 seconds (no reverb)
‚Ä¢ ConvolutionReverb: CRASHED
‚Ä¢ ShimmerReverb: 0 seconds (no reverb)
‚Ä¢ GatedReverb: 0 seconds (no reverb)

None of the reverbs produce measurable reverberation time!

Delay Time Accuracy (Delays):
‚Ä¢ DigitalDelay: 5ms measured (but comb spacing suggests 21ms)
‚Ä¢ MagneticDrumEcho: Not properly measured
‚Ä¢ BucketBrigadeDelay: CRASHED

Feedback Stability:
‚Ä¢ DigitalDelay: 0.94 threshold (excellent stability)
‚Ä¢ MagneticDrumEcho: Unknown
‚Ä¢ BucketBrigadeDelay: CRASHED

THD Analysis:
‚Ä¢ DigitalDelay: 0.24% ‚úì
‚Ä¢ All others: Could not measure or excessive

PARAMETER FUNCTIONALITY SUMMARY:
=================================
‚Ä¢ GatedReverb: 0/8 parameters working (0%)
‚Ä¢ PlateReverb: 2/8 parameters working (25%)
‚Ä¢ MagneticDrumEcho: 2/8 parameters working (25%)
‚Ä¢ DigitalDelay: 3/8 parameters working (38%)
‚Ä¢ ShimmerReverb: 7/8 parameters working (88%)
‚Ä¢ SpringReverb: 8/8 parameters working (100%)
‚Ä¢ BucketBrigadeDelay: CRASHED
‚Ä¢ ConvolutionReverb: CRASHED

Average: 3.3/8 parameters working (41%) excluding crashes

CRITICAL FINDINGS:
==================

1. NO WORKING REVERBS: All 5 reverb engines either crash or produce no reverb
2. RT60 = 0 for all testable reverbs indicates no reverb algorithm is functioning
3. 25% crash rate is unacceptable for production
4. Parameter responsiveness doesn't correlate with functionality (SpringReverb has 8/8 working params but 0 quality)
5. Only DigitalDelay shows professional-grade implementation

COMPARISON WITH OTHER CATEGORIES:
==================================
‚Ä¢ Pitch/Frequency: Mixed (some A grades, some failures)
‚Ä¢ Dynamics: 33% production ready
‚Ä¢ Modulation: 0% production ready
‚Ä¢ Filter: 0% production ready
‚Ä¢ Time-Based: 12.5% production ready ‚ö†

RECOMMENDATIONS:
================

IMMEDIATE FIXES REQUIRED:
1. Debug and fix crashes in BucketBrigadeDelay and ConvolutionReverb
2. Implement actual reverb algorithms in all reverb engines (currently missing!)
3. Fix parameter mapping in DigitalDelay (Time and Feedback not working)

COMPLETE REWRITES NEEDED:
1. All reverb engines need complete DSP implementation
2. BucketBrigadeDelay needs rewrite from scratch
3. ConvolutionReverb needs proper buffer management

SPECIFIC ALGORITHM REQUIREMENTS:
‚Ä¢ PlateReverb: Needs allpass diffusion network and proper plate simulation
‚Ä¢ SpringReverb: Needs spring tank simulation with proper dispersion
‚Ä¢ ConvolutionReverb: Needs proper IR loading and convolution engine
‚Ä¢ ShimmerReverb: Needs pitch shifter in feedback loop (completely missing)
‚Ä¢ GatedReverb: Needs gate detector and envelope follower (not implemented)

SUCCESS METRICS:
================
‚Ä¢ Production Ready: 1/8 (12.5%) - Only DigitalDelay
‚Ä¢ Partially Working: 1/8 (12.5%) - MagneticDrumEcho
‚Ä¢ Completely Broken: 4/8 (50%)
‚Ä¢ Crashes: 2/8 (25%)

CONCLUSION:
===========
The Time-Based category shows a stark divide: DigitalDelay is nearly perfect (A+ grade)
while EVERY reverb engine is completely non-functional. This suggests:

1. The delay implementation was done by someone competent
2. The reverb engines were never properly implemented
3. No testing was done on the reverb algorithms
4. The reverb engines may be placeholder code

The complete absence of RT60 measurements across all reverbs indicates these are not
real reverb implementations but rather broken stubs or incorrectly initialized objects.

Priority should be given to implementing actual reverb algorithms, as currently the
plugin has NO working reverb effects despite claiming to have 5 different types.
