                    DYNAMICS ENGINES TEST SUMMARY
================================================================================
Date: August 21, 2025
Framework: Comprehensive Engine Analyzer v1.0

ENGINES TESTED:
===============

1. ClassicCompressor
   - Quality Score: 64.16/100
   - Grade: D
   - Issues: 
     * High THD (7.17%)
     * Poor compression curve
     * Attack delay issues (1.21ms)
   - Status: NEEDS MAJOR FIXES

2. VintageOptoCompressor  
   - Quality Score: 13.99/100
   - Grade: D
   - Issues:
     * Extremely high THD (30.34%)
     * Fast rise time (not opto-like behavior)
     * Not authentic vintage emulation
   - Status: NEEDS COMPLETE REWRITE

3. NoiseGate
   - Quality Score: 95.00/100
   - Grade: A+
   - Strengths:
     * Proper gating behavior
     * Clean operation
     * All parameters working
   - Status: EXCELLENT - Production Ready

REMAINING TO TEST:
==================
- MasteringLimiter_Platinum
- TransientShaper_Platinum
- DimensionExpander
- NoiseGate_Platinum (if different from NoiseGate)
- SpectralGate / SpectralGate_Platinum

SUMMARY:
========
- 1 out of 3 engines tested are production ready (33%)
- 2 engines need major work or complete rewrites
- ClassicCompressor and VintageOptoCompressor are critically broken

RECOMMENDATIONS:
================
1. NoiseGate - Keep as is, excellent implementation
2. ClassicCompressor - Fix compression curve, reduce THD, improve timing
3. VintageOptoCompressor - Complete rewrite needed, current implementation is broken
