Tested 6 dynamics engines with comprehensive analysis including:
- Waveform analysis
- Spectral/FFT analysis  
- THD measurements
- Artifact detection
- Parameter functionality
- Core feature validation

RESULTS OVERVIEW:
=================
✅ Production Ready (2/6):
   - NoiseGate: A+ (95.00/100)
   - DimensionExpander: B (81.50/100)

❌ Critical Issues (4/6):
   - MasteringLimiter_Platinum: D (0.00/100) - COMPLETELY BROKEN
   - TransientShaper_Platinum: D (8.71/100) - NON-FUNCTIONAL
   - VintageOptoCompressor: D (13.99/100) - NOT AUTHENTIC
   - ClassicCompressor: D (64.16/100) - HIGH DISTORTION

DETAILED RESULTS:
=================

1. NoiseGate [A+ - 95.00/100] ✅ EXCELLENT
   --------------------------------------------
   Strengths:
   • Perfect gating behavior (22 openings/closings matched)
   • Clean operation with minimal artifacts (1 click)
   • All parameters functioning correctly
   • Good noise reduction capability
   
   Issues:
   • Attack time measurement showed 0ms (may be too fast)
   
   Verdict: PRODUCTION READY - Minor tweaks only

2. DimensionExpander [B - 81.50/100] ✅ GOOD
   --------------------------------------------
   Strengths:
   • Stereo widening working (0.122 width increase)
   • Excellent mono compatibility (0.949)
   • Phase correlation maintained (0.817)
   • Low artifact count
   
   Issues:
   • 15.5% channel imbalance
   • 6 phase discontinuities detected
   • Some parameters show minimal effect
   
   Verdict: PRODUCTION READY - Could use refinement

3. ClassicCompressor [D - 64.16/100] ⚠️ NEEDS WORK
   --------------------------------------------
   Issues:
   • High THD: 7.17%
   • Poor compression behavior
   • Attack delay: 1.21ms
   • Inconsistent gain reduction
   
   Fixes Needed:
   • Reduce harmonic distortion
   • Fix compression curve
   • Improve timing response
   
   Verdict: MAJOR FIXES REQUIRED

4. VintageOptoCompressor [D - 13.99/100] ❌ BROKEN
   --------------------------------------------
   Critical Issues:
   • Extreme THD: 30.34%
   • Fast rise time (2.79ms) - not opto-like
   • Not authentic vintage behavior
   • Parameters not working as expected
   
   Fixes Needed:
   • Complete rewrite with proper opto modeling
   • Implement slow attack/release characteristics
   • Add proper tube-like saturation
   
   Verdict: COMPLETE REWRITE NEEDED

5. TransientShaper_Platinum [D - 8.71/100] ❌ BROKEN
   --------------------------------------------
   Critical Issues:
   • Attack enhancement not working (1.69dB only)
   • Sustain reduction not working (1.85dB increase!)
   • Minimal parameter effect (0.205dB range)
   • High THD: 18.15%
   
   Fixes Needed:
   • Completely reimplement envelope detection
   • Fix attack/sustain processing
   • Make parameters actually affect signal
   
   Verdict: COMPLETE REWRITE NEEDED

6. MasteringLimiter_Platinum [D - 0.00/100] ❌ CRITICALLY BROKEN
   --------------------------------------------
   Critical Issues:
   • Extreme THD: 31.58%
   • Brickwall limiting working but with poor transparency
   • Massive quality issues
   • Some parameters cause clipping (71 clips detected)
   
   Fixes Needed:
   • Complete algorithm overhaul
   • Implement proper lookahead
   • Fix transparency issues
   • Ensure no output exceeds 0dB
   
   Verdict: COMPLETE REWRITE NEEDED - WORST PERFORMER

PARAMETER ANALYSIS SUMMARY:
============================
Working Parameters:
• NoiseGate: All 8 parameters functional
• DimensionExpander: Most parameters working
• ClassicCompressor: Parameters work but produce poor results

Non-functional Parameters:
• TransientShaper: Attack/Sustain have minimal effect
• VintageOptoCompressor: Many parameters don't behave correctly
• MasteringLimiter: Some parameters cause clipping

RECOMMENDATIONS:
================

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
1. MasteringLimiter_Platinum - Complete rewrite urgently needed
2. TransientShaper_Platinum - Non-functional, needs rewrite
3. VintageOptoCompressor - False advertising, needs authentic implementation

MODERATE PRIORITY:
4. ClassicCompressor - Fix distortion and compression curve

MINOR TWEAKS:
5. DimensionExpander - Reduce channel imbalance
6. NoiseGate - Already excellent, optional improvements only

SUCCESS RATE:
=============
• 33% (2/6) Production Ready
• 17% (1/6) Fixable with moderate work  
• 50% (3/6) Require complete rewrites

CONCLUSION:
===========
The dynamics category has serious quality issues. Half of the engines tested
are fundamentally broken and need complete rewrites. Only NoiseGate stands out
as an excellent implementation. The "Platinum" labeled engines ironically 
performed the worst, suggesting these may be incomplete or broken implementations.

Priority should be given to fixing MasteringLimiter_Platinum as a mastering
limiter is critical for production use and the current implementation is
completely unusable with 0/100 score.
