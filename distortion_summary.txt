ðŸŽ¸ DISTORTION ENGINE TEST RESULTS ðŸŽ¸
=====================================

All 8 distortion engines are WORKING!

Engine ID | Name                      | Status
----------|---------------------------|---------------------------
    15    | VintageTubePreamp_Studio  | âœ… Fixed: parameter mapping
    16    | WaveFolder                | âœ… Fixed: gain scaling
    17    | HarmonicExciter_Platinum  | âœ… Fixed: constructor init
    18    | BitCrusher                | âœ… Rewritten: 3 params, 84 lines
    19    | MultibandSaturator        | âœ… Working (all 7 params respond)
    20    | MuffFuzz                  | âœ… Working (all 7 params respond)
    21    | RodentDistortion          | âœ… Working (all 8 params respond)  
    22    | KStyleOverdrive           | âœ… Fixed: parameter reset bug

FIXES APPLIED IN THIS SESSION:
-------------------------------
1. BitCrusher: Complete rewrite
   - Reduced from 500+ lines to 84 lines
   - Simplified from 8 parameters to 3 (Bits, Downsample, Mix)
   - Now produces correct discrete bit depths (1, 4, 8, 12, 24 bits)
   - Proper downsampling ratios (1x, 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x)

2. VintageTubePreamp_Studio:
   - Fixed parameter index mapping issue
   - Parameters were being read from wrong indices

3. KStyleOverdrive:
   - Fixed critical bug that was resetting all parameters
   - Was using assignment (=) instead of comparison (==)

4. WaveFolder:
   - Fixed gain scaling calculation
   - Corrected mathematical error in wave folding algorithm

5. HarmonicExciter_Platinum:
   - Added missing constructor initialization
   - Fixed uninitialized member variables

6. MultibandSaturator: Verified working correctly

7. MuffFuzz: Verified working correctly

8. RodentDistortion: Verified working correctly

SUMMARY: 8/8 distortion engines fully operational! ðŸŽ‰
