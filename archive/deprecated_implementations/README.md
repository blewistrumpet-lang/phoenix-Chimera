# Deprecated Engine Implementations Archive

This directory contains historical implementations of DSP engines that have been replaced by more advanced versions in the active codebase.

## Files Archived

### _OLD Files
These are earlier implementations that have been superseded by improved versions:
- **CombResonator_OLD.h/cpp** - Earlier implementation of the Comb Resonator engine
- **PhasedVocoder_OLD.h/cpp** - Earlier implementation of the Phased Vocoder engine 
- **PitchShifter_OLD.h/cpp** - Earlier implementation of the Pitch Shifter engine
- **TapeEcho_OLD.h/cpp** - Earlier implementation of the Tape Echo engine

### _Reference Files
These are reference implementations that may contain alternative algorithms:
- **StereoChorus_Reference.h/cpp** - Reference implementation of Stereo Chorus

### _Original Files  
These are original implementations preserved for historical comparison:
- **StateVariableFilter_Original.h/cpp** - Original implementation of State Variable Filter

## Why These Were Archived

All of these files have been replaced by more sophisticated implementations that include:
- Better audio quality and stability
- Professional-grade parameter smoothing
- Improved memory management
- Enhanced DSP algorithms
- Better performance optimization
