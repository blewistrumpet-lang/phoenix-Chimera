# Chimera Plugin Fixes Applied

## Summary of All Fixes Applied to Address Engine Processing Issues

### UPDATE: Critical Stability Fixes Added

### 1. **Thread Safety Fixes** (NEW)
- ✅ Added mutex protection for engine loading/swapping
- ✅ Fixed race conditions between parameter changes and audio processing
- ✅ Protected against null pointer access during engine swaps
- ✅ Thread-safe access in processBlock method

### 2. **Buffer Validation** (NEW)
- ✅ Added buffer size validation (0 < samples <= 8192)
- ✅ Prevents crashes from abnormal buffer sizes
- ✅ Clears buffer and returns early on invalid sizes

### 3. **Parameter Mapping Fixes**
- ✅ Fixed parameter update loop to process all 15 parameters (was only 10)
- ✅ Created `getMixParameterIndex()` function for correct Mix parameter mapping
- ✅ Mix parameters now correctly mapped to indices 3, 5, 6, or 7 depending on engine type

### 4. **Mix Parameter Default Values**
- ✅ Increased all Mix defaults from 0.3-0.5 to 0.8-1.0
- ✅ Distortion/Filter effects: 100% wet (1.0)
- ✅ Time-based effects (reverb/delay): 80% wet (0.8)
- ✅ Compressors: 100% wet (1.0)

### 5. **Gain Compensation**
- ✅ Reduced gain compensation from 5% (0.95x) to 1% (0.99x)
- ✅ Adjusted soft clipping threshold from 0.95 to 0.98
- ✅ Raised hard limit from ±0.95 to ±0.98

### 6. **Diagnostic System**
- ✅ Added comprehensive diagnostic that tests all 57 engines
- ✅ Diagnostic runs on first plugin load
- ✅ Tests each engine with appropriate parameters and 100% mix

## Expected Results

With these fixes, engines should now:
1. Process audio with clearly audible effects
2. Have proper wet/dry mix control
3. Not suffer from excessive gain reduction
4. Work correctly with all 15 parameters

## To Test

1. Load plugin in Logic
2. Select any engine (e.g., Rodent Distortion, Plate Reverb)
3. You should immediately hear the effect at 80-100% mix
4. Adjust parameters - they should all respond correctly

## Diagnostic Output

The diagnostic will output to Console.app showing:
- Which engines pass/fail audio modification tests
- RMS level changes for each engine
- Mix parameter values being used

Check Console.app with filter "Chimera" to see results.

## Remaining Issues to Investigate

Based on user feedback, engines are still not processing correctly despite these fixes:
1. **Engine Processing Logic** - Engines may have deeper implementation issues
2. **Buffer Processing** - Some engines might not handle in-place processing correctly
3. **State Management** - Complex engines (FFT, granular) may have initialization issues
4. **Platform-Specific Code** - SIMD optimizations may cause problems on ARM Macs

The stability fixes should prevent crashes, but engine functionality still needs investigation.
