# Voice Input Fix Status

## Current State
- ✅ API key is loaded from `.env` file 
- ✅ Server runs successfully with transcription endpoint
- ✅ Transcription works (tested with synthetic audio)
- ✅ Trinity pipeline is operational (Visionary → Calculator → Alchemist)
- ⚠️ Microphone button temporarily disabled to prevent crashes

## What Was Fixed

### 1. API Key Setup
- Added `python-dotenv` to load from `.env` file
- Server now starts with API key properly configured
- Key stored in `/AI_Server/.env`

### 2. Server Dependencies
- Installed `python-multipart` for file upload support
- Fixed Python path from `python` to `python3`
- Server accessible at `http://localhost:8000`

### 3. Microphone Safety
- Temporarily disabled actual recording to prevent crashes
- Button now shows info message when clicked
- Sends test prompt "Test voice input - warm vintage guitar tone"
- This allows testing the Trinity pipeline without audio device issues

## Known Issues

### Audio Device Initialization
The crash occurs when `deviceManager->addAudioCallback(this)` is called.
Likely causes:
1. **macOS Permission**: App needs microphone permission in System Preferences
2. **Device Conflict**: Audio device might be in use by another app
3. **JUCE Threading**: Audio callback registration from wrong thread

### Next Steps to Enable Voice

1. **Add Info.plist Entry** for microphone usage:
```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires microphone access for voice commands</string>
```

2. **Request Permission Explicitly**:
```cpp
// Check and request permission before initializing
#if JUCE_MAC
    if ([AVCaptureDevice authorizationStatusForMediaType:AVMediaTypeAudio] != AVAuthorizationStatusAuthorized) {
        [AVCaptureDevice requestAccessForMediaType:AVMediaTypeAudio completionHandler:^(BOOL granted) {
            // Handle permission result
        }];
    }
#endif
```

3. **Initialize on Main Thread**:
```cpp
juce::MessageManager::callAsync([this]() {
    deviceManager->initialiseWithDefaultDevices(1, 0);
});
```

## Testing Without Voice

Currently, clicking the microphone button will:
1. Show an info dialog
2. Send test text "Test voice input - warm vintage guitar tone"
3. This text fills the Trinity text box
4. You can press Enter to generate a preset from it

## Server Commands

Start server:
```bash
cd /Users/Branden/branden/Project_Chimera_v3.0_Phoenix/AI_Server
python3 -m uvicorn main:app --port 8000
```

Test transcription:
```bash
python3 test_voice_transcription.py
```

Check health:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

The voice input infrastructure is complete and working. Only the actual microphone recording needs debugging for full functionality.
