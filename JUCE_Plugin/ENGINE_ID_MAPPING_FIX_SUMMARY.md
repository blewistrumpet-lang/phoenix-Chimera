# CRITICAL FIX: Engine ID Mapping - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **ENGINE_BYPASS Not Handled in EngineFactory**
- **Problem**: EngineFactory::createEngine() had no case for ENGINE_BYPASS (-1), causing nullptr returns
- **Fix**: Added case for ENGINE_BYPASS to return BypassEngine instance
- **File**: EngineFactory.cpp, line 60

### 2. **Missing Engines in Mapping and Choices**
- **Problem**: Engines 51, 54, 55 were missing from both engineChoices array and mapping table
- **Fix**: Added "Stereo Widener", "Dynamic EQ", "Stereo Imager" to choices array and mapping
- **Files**: PluginProcessor.cpp, lines 61-63 (mapping), lines 107-108 (choices)

### 3. **Incorrect ENGINE_COUNT**
- **Problem**: ENGINE_COUNT was 53 but highest engine ID was 55
- **Fix**: Updated ENGINE_COUNT to 56 (covering IDs 0-55)
- **File**: EngineTypes.h, line 85

## Verified Working Components

### ✅ Bidirectional Mapping System
- Complete mapping table with 54 entries (including bypass)
- engineIDToChoiceIndex() and choiceIndexToEngineID() functions
- Proper error handling with debug logging

### ✅ Parameter Change Handling
- parameterChanged() correctly converts choice index to engine ID
- Uses mapping functions for conversion

### ✅ Preset Loading
- loadPresetFromJSON() properly converts AI engine IDs to choice indices
- Special handling for "_engine" parameters (lines 997-1002)

### ✅ Test Results
All tests pass:
- No missing engine mappings
- Round-trip conversions work correctly
- No duplicate choice indices
- ENGINE_CHAOS_GENERATOR (41) correctly maps to choice index 44

## Definition of Done ✅
- [x] Mapping table includes ALL engines (54 total)
- [x] AI presets load correct engines
- [x] Manual UI selection works correctly
- [x] No array index out of bounds errors
- [x] Unit tests pass for all engine IDs
- [x] ENGINE_BYPASS handled properly

## How the System Works Now

1. **UI Dropdown** (54 choices):
   - Index 0: "Bypass" (ENGINE_BYPASS = -1)
   - Index 1-53: All implemented engines

2. **Engine IDs**:
   - -1: ENGINE_BYPASS
   - 0-55: Regular engines (with gaps at 10, 13, 37)

3. **Conversion Flow**:
   ```
   AI Server sends engine ID 41 (CHAOS_GENERATOR)
   ↓
   engineIDToChoiceIndex(41) returns 44
   ↓
   Set parameter value to 44
   ↓
   parameterChanged receives choice index 44
   ↓
   choiceIndexToEngineID(44) returns 41
   ↓
   EngineFactory::createEngine(41) creates ChaosGenerator
   ```

## Testing Command
```bash
g++ -I. -I./Source -std=c++17 Source/test_engine_mapping.cpp -o test_engine_mapping && ./test_engine_mapping
```

All critical engine ID mapping issues have been resolved.
