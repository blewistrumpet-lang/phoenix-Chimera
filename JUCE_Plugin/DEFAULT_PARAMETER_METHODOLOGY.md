# Chimera Phoenix Default Parameter Methodology

## Philosophy & Core Principles

The Chimera Phoenix default parameter system is designed around the principle of **immediate musical satisfaction**. Every engine should sound inspiring and professional from the moment it loads, eliminating the barrier of parameter tweaking before users can be creative.

### 10 Core Design Principles

1. **Safety First**: All defaults avoid harsh, unusable, or potentially damaging sounds
2. **Musical Utility**: Each engine sounds good immediately upon loading  
3. **Moderate Values**: Most parameters start in the 0.3-0.7 range for balanced behavior
4. **Conservative Drive**: Drive/gain parameters start low (0.2-0.4) to prevent harshness
5. **Appropriate Mix**: Mix levels optimized per engine type for immediate impact
6. **Musical Timing**: Time-based effects use musical note values (1/16, 1/8, 1/4 notes)
7. **Controlled Feedback**: Conservative feedback (0.2-0.4) to avoid runaway conditions
8. **Smooth Resonance**: Moderate Q/resonance (0.3-0.5) for musicality without self-oscillation
9. **Unity Gain**: Output levels maintain consistent volume across engines
10. **First Impression**: Users should hear something inspiring immediately

## Methodology by Engine Category

### Distortion & Saturation Engines (100% Mix, 20-30% Drive)

**Philosophy**: Distortion engines should add character and warmth without being harsh or overwhelming. The goal is musical saturation that enhances rather than destroys the source material.

**Mix Strategy**: 80-100% wet for full character transformation
- Distortion effects work best when they replace rather than blend with the dry signal
- 100% wet allows users to hear the full character immediately
- Parallel blending can be achieved with external mixing

**Drive Strategy**: Conservative 20-40% for musical saturation
- Low drive prevents harsh digital clipping artifacts
- Allows tube/analog modeling to shine through
- Users can increase drive for more intensity as needed
- Prevents ear fatigue during extended sessions

**Examples**:
- **K-Style Overdrive**: Drive=0.3, Tone=0.5, Mix=1.0
  - Drive at 30% provides smooth Klon-style warmth without harshness
  - Tone centered for balanced frequency response
  - 100% wet to hear full overdrive character

- **Vintage Tube**: Drive=0.4, Warmth=0.3, Mix=1.0  
  - Higher drive acceptable due to softer tube saturation curve
  - Warmth at 30% for subtle harmonic enhancement
  - Full wet for complete tube preamp experience

### Reverb Engines (25-35% Mix, Medium Decay)

**Philosophy**: Reverbs should add space and dimension without making the mix muddy or distant. The goal is to enhance the source with appropriate spatial context.

**Mix Strategy**: 25-35% for noticeable but tasteful ambience
- Lower mix prevents the "swimming in reverb" effect
- Allows source material to remain present and defined
- Provides immediate spatial enhancement
- Professional mixing starting point

**Decay Strategy**: Medium decay times for musical sustainability
- Too short: Sounds unnatural and gated
- Too long: Creates muddy, unfocused mix
- Sweet spot: 0.4-0.6 range for most musical applications

**Examples**:
- **Plate Reverb**: Size=0.6, Decay=0.4, Mix=0.3
  - Size at 60% for medium plate character
  - Decay at 40% for controlled tail length
  - Mix at 30% for professional spatial enhancement

- **Shimmer Reverb**: Size=0.5, Shimmer=0.4, Mix=0.3
  - Moderate shimmer amount for ethereal character without artifacts
  - Conservative mix to prevent overwhelming pitch-shifted content

### Delay Engines (25-35% Mix, Musical Timing, 2-3 Repeats)

**Philosophy**: Delays should provide rhythmic enhancement and depth without cluttering the mix. Musical timing relationships are essential for groove and pocket.

**Mix Strategy**: 25-35% for rhythmic support without competition
- Delays work best as supporting elements
- Too much mix creates confusion with main rhythm
- Enough presence to add groove and interest

**Timing Strategy**: Musical note values based on 120 BPM
- 1/16 note (93.75ms): Tight rhythmic enhancement
- 1/8 note (187.5ms): Classic delay timing  
- 1/4 note (375ms): Spacious echo effect
- Based on 60,000ms รท BPM รท subdivision

**Feedback Strategy**: 2-3 repeats maximum for clarity
- 0.2-0.4 range provides musical repetition
- Prevents infinite feedback scenarios
- Maintains mix clarity and definition

**Examples**:
- **Tape Echo**: Time=0.375 (1/8 note), Feedback=0.3, Mix=0.5
  - Classic 1/8 note delay timing for versatility
  - Moderate feedback for 2-3 clear repeats
  - Higher mix acceptable due to tape warmth and filtering

- **Digital Delay**: Time=0.375, Feedback=0.25, Mix=0.4  
  - Same timing but lower feedback for cleaner repeats
  - Lower mix due to pristine digital character

### Modulation Engines (30-50% Mix, Subtle Movement, 2-5Hz)

**Philosophy**: Modulation should add life and movement without creating nausea or disorientation. The goal is subtle animation that enhances musicality.

**Rate Strategy**: Musical rates synchronized to human perception
- 0.2-0.4 range corresponds to 2-5Hz modulation
- Avoids nauseating frequencies (6-10Hz)
- Matches natural vibrato and tremolo rates
- Can be increased for special effects

**Depth Strategy**: Noticeable but not overwhelming movement
- 0.3-0.5 range for engaging modulation
- Prevents seasickness effect from excessive depth
- Allows source material to remain recognizable
- Musical sweet spot for most applications

**Mix Strategy**: Balanced blend for movement without artifacts
- 30-50% mix shows clear modulation character
- Prevents phase cancellation issues
- Maintains source definition

**Examples**:
- **Classic Tremolo**: Rate=0.4 (~4Hz), Depth=0.4, Mix=1.0
  - Classic tremolo rate for musical pulsing
  - Moderate depth for engaging amplitude modulation
  - Full wet for traditional tremolo effect

- **Stereo Chorus**: Rate=0.4, Depth=0.4, Mix=0.5
  - Musical chorus rate for lush movement
  - Balanced mix to avoid phase issues

### Filter Engines (Variable Mix, Midrange Cutoff, Musical Resonance)

**Philosophy**: Filters should shape tone and character without being harsh or self-oscillating. The goal is musical filtering that enhances rather than destroys harmonic content.

**Cutoff Strategy**: Midrange starting point for versatility
- 0.4-0.6 range places cutoff around 1kHz
- Allows both low-pass and high-pass movements
- Preserves most of the audible spectrum initially
- Natural starting point for filter sweeps

**Resonance Strategy**: Musical enhancement without self-oscillation
- 0.0-0.4 range for controlled resonance
- Adds character without harsh peaks
- Prevents filter from overwhelming the signal
- Allows musical filter sweeps

**Mix Strategy**: Depends on filter type and purpose
- Creative filters: 50-70% for blending
- Corrective filters: 100% for full processing
- Effects filters: Variable based on desired impact

**Examples**:
- **Ladder Filter**: Cutoff=0.6, Resonance=0.4, Mix=1.0
  - Upper midrange cutoff for natural sound
  - Moderate resonance for Moog-style character
  - Full wet for complete filter processing

### Dynamic Engines (100% Mix, Musical Ratios, Transparent Operation)

**Philosophy**: Dynamics processors should enhance and control without being obvious or pumping. The goal is transparent level control that improves the mix.

**Mix Strategy**: 100% wet for full dynamic control
- Dynamics processors replace rather than blend
- Parallel compression achieved through external routing
- Full processing ensures consistent level control

**Threshold Strategy**: Musical compression amounts
- 0.4-0.7 range for moderate gain reduction
- Prevents over-compression and pumping
- Maintains natural dynamics while controlling peaks
- Professional mixing starting point

**Ratio Strategy**: Musical compression ratios
- 0.3-0.5 range corresponds to 3:1 to 6:1 ratios
- Sweet spot for transparent compression
- Avoids brick-wall limiting effects
- Maintains musical dynamics

**Attack/Release Strategy**: Transparent operation
- Fast attack (0.1-0.3) for peak control
- Medium release (0.3-0.6) for natural decay
- Prevents pumping and breathing artifacts

**Examples**:
- **VCA Compressor**: Threshold=0.4, Ratio=0.5, Attack=0.2, Release=0.4
  - Moderate threshold for musical compression
  - 4:1 ratio for controlled dynamics
  - Fast attack for peak control
  - Medium release for natural sound

### Spatial Engines (Variable Mix, Balanced Processing)

**Philosophy**: Spatial processors should enhance the stereo image and placement without creating phase issues or unnatural positioning.

**Mix Strategy**: Depends on processing type
- Widening effects: 50-70% to avoid phase issues
- M/S processing: 100% for full control
- Positioning effects: Variable based on desired placement

**Processing Strategy**: Conservative enhancement
- Avoid extreme width settings that cause mono compatibility issues
- Maintain center image stability
- Enhance rather than replace natural stereo information

**Examples**:
- **Stereo Widener**: Width=0.5, Bass Mono=0.5, Mix=1.0
  - Moderate widening for enhanced stereo image
  - Bass mono to maintain low-end stability
  - Full processing for complete width control

### Utility Engines (100% Mix, Unity Gain, Neutral Settings)

**Philosophy**: Utility processors should start in neutral positions that don't alter the signal, allowing users to make conscious adjustments.

**Strategy**: Neutral starting points for all parameters
- Gain controls at unity (0.5 = 0dB)
- Processing controls at neutral positions
- Mode switches at default positions
- 100% mix for full utility processing

**Examples**:
- **Gain Utility**: All gains=0.5 (0dB), Mode=0 (Stereo)
  - Unity gain starting point
  - Standard stereo mode
  - No phase inversions or channel swaps

### Experimental/Spectral Engines (20-30% Mix, Conservative Settings)

**Philosophy**: Experimental and spectral processors have the potential for extreme effects that can be unusable or harsh. Conservative defaults allow users to explore safely.

**Mix Strategy**: Low mix for safe exploration
- 20-30% mix prevents overwhelming effects
- Allows users to hear the character without extremes
- Can be increased once users understand the effect

**Processing Strategy**: Conservative parameter values
- Lower intensity settings for safe starting points
- Avoid parameter combinations that create artifacts
- Enable exploration without immediate harshness

**Examples**:
- **Spectral Freeze**: Freeze=0.0, Blend=0.5, Mix=0.3
  - Not frozen initially (normal operation)
  - Balanced blend when freezing is engaged
  - Low mix for subtle spectral effects
