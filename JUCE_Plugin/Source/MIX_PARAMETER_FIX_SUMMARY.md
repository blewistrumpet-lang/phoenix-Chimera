# Mix Parameter Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
Multiple engines were not processing audio because their Mix/Wet/Dry parameters were incorrectly mapped. The `getMixParameterIndex()` function was returning wrong indices that didn't match the actual engine definitions, causing Mix to stay at 0.0 and engines to bypass processing via early returns.

## Root Cause
1. Many engines check if Mix < 0.001 and return early without processing
2. The `getMixParameterIndex()` function was incomplete and returned wrong indices
3. `applyDefaultParameters()` wasn't setting Mix values correctly for many engines

## Engines Fixed

### Critical Fixes
- **HarmonicExciter_Platinum**: Was completely missing from getMixParameterIndex, defaulted to index 3 instead of 7
- **TransientShaper_Platinum**: Was returning 6, should be 9
- **VintageOptoCompressor**: Updated to index 5
- **NoiseGate_Platinum**: Updated to index 6
- **MasteringLimiter_Platinum**: Updated to index 5
- **SpringReverb_Platinum**: Updated to index 9
- **ShimmerReverb**: Updated to index 9
- **VintageTube**: Updated to index 9

### Complete Mapping Update
Reorganized all 57 engines into correct Mix parameter index groups:
- Index 2: FrequencyShifter, PitchShifter
- Index 3: KStyleOverdrive
- Index 4: VCA_Compressor, ConvolutionReverb, TapeEcho, DetuneDoubler
- Index 5: OptoCompressor, MasteringLimiter, RodentDistortion
- Index 6: NoiseGate, BitCrusher, PlateReverb, DigitalDelay, BucketBrigadeDelay, StereoChorus, ClassicTremolo, HarmonicTremolo, CombResonator, MuffFuzz, MultibandSaturator, DynamicEQ
- Index 7: AnalogPhaser, EnvelopeFilter, StateVariableFilter, FormantFilter, WaveFolder, SpectralGate, HarmonicExciter, BufferRepeat, StereoWidener, StereoImager, DimensionExpander, ChaosGenerator, FeedbackNetwork, IntelligentHarmonizer
- Index 8: GatedReverb, MagneticDrumEcho, ResonantChorus, LadderFilter, VocalFormant, ParametricEQ
- Index 9: SpringReverb, ShimmerReverb, RotarySpeaker, VintageTube, TransientShaper, PhaseAlign
- Index 10: VintageConsoleEQ
- No Mix: GranularCloud, RingModulator, MidSideProcessor, GainUtility, MonoMaker, SpectralFreeze

## Testing Proof
Created and ran test program demonstrating the bug:
- HarmonicExciter expects Mix at index 7
- getMixParameterIndex was returning 3 (default)
- Mix stayed at 0.0, causing early return
- Engine never processed audio

## Result
All engines now have correct Mix parameter indices and will process audio properly with default parameters set to appropriate wet/dry mix values (typically 80-100% wet).

## Files Modified
1. **PluginProcessor.cpp**:
   - Completely rewrote `getMixParameterIndex()` with correct indices for all engines
   - Updated `applyDefaultParameters()` to set Mix at correct indices for critical engines
