# Channel Count Limitations Fix Report

## Summary
Fixed hardcoded 2-channel limitations in three audio processing engines to support up to 8 channels for surround sound configurations while maintaining backwards compatibility with stereo.

## Engines Fixed

### 1. MultibandSaturator (/Users/Branden/branden/Project_Chimera_v3.0_Phoenix/JUCE_Plugin/Source/MultibandSaturator.cpp)
- **Issue**: `static constexpr int kMaxChannels = 2;` limited processing to stereo only
- **Fix**: Changed to `static constexpr int kMaxChannels = 8;`
- **Impact**: Now supports up to 8 channels (suitable for 7.1 surround sound)
- **Safety**: Existing bounds checking with `std::min(buffer.getNumChannels(), kMaxChannels)` prevents buffer overruns

### 2. WaveFolder (/Users/Branden/branden/Project_Chimera_v3.0_Phoenix/JUCE_Plugin/Source/WaveFolder.cpp)
- **Issue**: `static constexpr int MAX_CHANNELS = 2;` limited processing to stereo only
- **Fix**: Changed to `static constexpr int MAX_CHANNELS = 8;`
- **Impact**: Now supports up to 8 channels with full oversampling and quality features
- **Safety**: Existing bounds checking with `std::min(buffer.getNumChannels(), Impl::MAX_CHANNELS)` prevents buffer overruns

### 3. PitchShifter (/Users/Branden/branden/Project_Chimera_v3.0_Phoenix/JUCE_Plugin/Source/PitchShifter.cpp)
- **Issue**: `static constexpr int MAX_CHANNELS = 2;` limited processing to stereo only
- **Fix**: Changed to `static constexpr int MAX_CHANNELS = 8;`
- **Impact**: Now supports up to 8 channels with full spectral processing
- **Safety**: Existing bounds checking with `std::min(buffer.getNumChannels(), Impl::MAX_CHANNELS)` prevents buffer overruns
- **Additional**: Updated stereo width processing to apply only to first stereo pair in multi-channel configurations

## Technical Details

### Memory Allocation
All engines use `std::array` for per-channel state, which means:
- Memory is allocated at compile time (no dynamic allocation in audio thread)
- All arrays are now sized for 8 channels: `std::array<ChannelState, MAX_CHANNELS>`
- No performance impact for stereo usage (unused channels are simply not processed)

### Bounds Checking
All engines implement proper bounds checking:
```cpp
const int numChannels = std::min(buffer.getNumChannels(), MAX_CHANNELS);
for (int ch = 0; ch < numChannels; ++ch) {
    // Process channel safely
}
```

### Backwards Compatibility
- Stereo (2-channel) processing remains identical
- Mono (1-channel) processing remains identical
- No changes to parameter interfaces or audio quality
- Existing projects will continue to work without modification

### Performance Impact
- **Stereo/Mono**: No performance impact (same code paths)
- **Multi-channel**: Linear scaling with channel count
- **Memory**: Fixed small increase (6 additional channel states per engine)

## Supported Channel Configurations
- **Mono**: 1 channel
- **Stereo**: 2 channels
- **Surround 5.1**: 6 channels
- **Surround 7.1**: 8 channels
- **Custom**: Any configuration up to 8 channels

## Testing
Created comprehensive test suite (`test_channel_compatibility.cpp`) that verifies:
- All engines process 1, 2, 6, and 8 channels correctly
- Output is finite and valid for all channel counts
- No buffer overruns or memory access violations
- Backwards compatibility with existing stereo configurations

## Future Considerations
If higher channel counts are needed (e.g., for immersive audio formats like Dolby Atmos), the `MAX_CHANNELS` constant can be increased to 16 or 32 with minimal code changes. The current limit of 8 channels covers all standard surround sound formats while keeping memory usage reasonable.

## Verification Commands
To verify the changes:
```bash
# Search for the updated constants
grep -n "MAX_CHANNELS = 8\|kMaxChannels = 8" *.cpp

# Verify bounds checking is in place
grep -n "std::min.*MAX_CHANNELS\|std::min.*kMaxChannels" *.cpp

# Run compatibility test
g++ -I/path/to/juce test_channel_compatibility.cpp -o test_channels && ./test_channels
```
