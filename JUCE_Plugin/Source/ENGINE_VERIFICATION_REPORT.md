# Chimera Phoenix Engine Verification Report

## Methodology
Each engine is checked for:
1. **Process Implementation**: Does process() actually modify the buffer?
2. **Parameter Mapping**: Are parameters correctly mapped from slot params (0-14)?
3. **Thread Safety**: No static variables in process()
4. **Buffer Safety**: Proper bounds checking
5. **Working in Logic**: Does it actually affect audio when loaded?

## Engine Status

### ✅ Engine 0: NoneEngine
- **Status**: Working (bypass/passthrough)
- **Notes**: Intentionally does nothing

### ⚠️ Engine 1: VintageOptoCompressor_Platinum

### ⚠️ Engine 2: ClassicCompressor
- **Process**: ✅ Full implementation with RMS detection, lookahead
- **Parameters**: Uses 0-9 (Threshold, Ratio, Attack, Release, Knee, Makeup, Mix, Lookahead, Auto-release, Sidechain)
- **Issues**: Previously had buffer overflow (fixed)
- **Test Result**: Should work

### ⚠️ Engine 15: VintageTubePreamp_Studio
- **Process**: ✅ Full WDF triode implementation
- **Parameters**: ⚠️ FIXED - Now uses 0=drive, 1-4=tone controls, 5=bright, 6=voicing, etc.
- **Issues**: Previously had bypass mapped incorrectly (fixed)
- **Test Result**: Should work after fix

### Engines 16-56: To be systematically checked...

## Summary of Issues Found

### Critical Issues
1. **Parameter Mapping**: Studio engines were expecting wrong parameter indices
2. **Bypass Handling**: Bypass was incorrectly mapped to param 0 instead of being handled by framework
3. **Buffer Overflows**: ClassicCompressor had potential overflow (fixed)

### Next Steps
1. Continue systematic verification of engines 3-6, 9-14, 16-56
2. Test each engine individually in Logic after verification
3. Fix any non-working engines one by one
4. Document parameter mappings for UI consistency
