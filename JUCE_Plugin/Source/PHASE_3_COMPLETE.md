# Phase 3 Migration Complete

## Summary
Successfully migrated all 57 DSP engines to use the centralized DspEngineUtilities framework.

## Key Changes

### DspEngineUtilities Integration
- Replaced all local denormal handling implementations with centralized DenormalGuard
- Unified all flushDenorm functions to use DSPUtils::flushDenorm
- Standardized DCBlocker usage across all engines
- Added scrubBuffer() calls to all process() methods for NaN/Inf cleanup

### Fixed Compilation Issues
1. **Include Order**: Ensured JuceHeader.h is included before DspEngineUtilities.h
2. **Namespace Conflicts**: Wrapped flushDenorm in DSPUtils namespace
3. **Class Conflicts**: Renamed local implementations that conflicted with utilities:
   - WaveFolderParam (custom smoothing parameter)
   - EnvelopeDCBlocker (block processing optimizations)
   - ExciterDCBlocker (sample rate adjustment)
   - EQOnePoleFilter (custom smoothing)
4. **Removed Redundant Code**: Eliminated duplicate DenormalGuard and DCBlocker definitions

### Files Modified
- All 57 engine .cpp and .h files
- DspEngineUtilities.h (fixed inline specifiers)
- Various specialized engines with custom requirements

## Build Status
âœ… **BUILD SUCCEEDED** - All targets compile successfully

## Next Steps
- Run comprehensive testing suite to verify DSP behavior
- Performance benchmarking to ensure no regressions
- Consider further optimizations using the unified framework

## Benefits Achieved
1. **Centralized Safety**: All DSP safety code in one place
2. **Consistent Behavior**: Unified denormal prevention across all engines
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to update and improve DSP safety
4. **Performance**: Hardware-accelerated FTZ/DAZ with RAII pattern
5. **Reliability**: Universal NaN/Inf cleanup prevents audio dropouts
