   - Clean state when switching presets

### Phase 3: Crash-Critical Issues (COMPLETED)
7. ✅ **SpectralFreeze Buffer Overflow**
   - Fixed: Array access beyond bounds at spectrum[i+1]
   - Changed loop condition to prevent overflow
   - Prevents memory corruption and crashes

8. ✅ **ConvolutionReverb Thread-Unsafe rand()**
   - Fixed: Replaced rand() with thread-safe JUCE Random
   - Uses thread_local storage for each thread
   - Eliminates crashes in multi-threaded hosts

9. ✅ **ClassicCompressor Unsafe Block Size**
   - Fixed: Implemented proper chunked processing
   - Processes large buffers in MAX_BLOCK_SIZE chunks
   - Prevents stack overflow and buffer overruns

### Phase 4: Audio Quality Critical (COMPLETED)
10. ✅ **LadderFilter Division by Zero**
    - Fixed: Added safety check for g parameter
    - Clamped g to prevent reaching -1
    - Eliminates NaN propagation and audio loss

11. ✅ **GranularCloud Infinite Loop Risk**
    - Fixed: Added strict grain count limits
    - Implemented iteration bounds and time limits
    - Prevents CPU spikes and runaway allocation

12. ✅ **PitchShifter Phase Drift**
    - Fixed: Replaced while loops with fmod()
    - Direct mathematical phase wrapping
    - Eliminates metallic artifacts and pitch instability

### Phase 5: Performance Optimization (COMPLETED)
13. ✅ **ConvolutionReverb Per-Sample Updates**
    - Fixed: Moved parameter updates outside sample loop
    - Updates once per block instead of per sample
    - Significant CPU usage reduction

14. ✅ **BucketBrigadeDelay Race Condition**
    - Fixed: Implemented atomic operations for bucket array
    - Thread-safe parameter updates with proper memory ordering
    - Eliminates clicking and inconsistent delay behavior
