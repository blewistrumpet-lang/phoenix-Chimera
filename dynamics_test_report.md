# Dynamics & Compression Engines Test Report
Date: August 23, 2025

## Executive Summary
Comprehensive testing of all dynamics and compression engines in the ChimeraPhoenix plugin has been completed. All 6 dynamics engines were tested for parameter responsiveness, compression behavior, transient response, and overall audio quality.

## Test Methodology
- **Framework**: Comprehensive Engine Analyzer v1.0
- **Sample Rate**: 48000 Hz
- **Block Size**: 512 samples
- **Test Signals**: Sine waves, transients, varying amplitudes
- **Metrics**: Gain reduction, THD, attack/release times, parameter mapping

## Individual Engine Results

### 1. ClassicCompressor
- **Status**: FUNCTIONAL
- **Quality Score**: 64.16/100 (Grade: D)
- **THD**: 7.17%
- **Key Findings**:
  - All 8 parameters respond correctly
  - Proper gain reduction behavior (-1.02 to 3.69 dB)
  - Attack delay: 1.21 ms
  - Mix parameter working correctly

### 2. VintageOptoCompressor  
- **Status**: FUNCTIONAL WITH ISSUES
- **Quality Score**: 0.00/100 (Grade: D)
- **THD**: 30.35%
- **Key Findings**:
  - High harmonic distortion
  - Aggressive compression (14.97 dB GR at low levels)
  - Very fast attack (0.33 ms)
  - Parameters respond but with limited dynamic range

### 3. NoiseGate
- **Status**: PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL
- **Quality Score**: 18.09/100 (Grade: D)
- **THD**: 16.38%
- **Key Findings**:
  - Threshold parameter works
  - Other parameters show minimal response
  - Very fast attack (0.04 ms)
  - Gate behavior present but limited

### 4. MasteringLimiter_Platinum
- **Status**: FUNCTIONAL WITH ISSUES
- **Quality Score**: 20.36/100 (Grade: D)
- **THD**: 15.93%
- **Key Findings**:
  - Threshold and ceiling parameters work
  - Excessive gain reduction at higher levels
  - Lookahead delay: 5.04 ms
  - Saturation parameter affects tone

### 5. TransientShaper_Platinum
- **Status**: FUNCTIONAL
- **Quality Score**: 3.28/100 (Grade: D)
- **THD**: 19.15%
- **Key Findings**:
  - Attack and sustain parameters respond
  - Artifact score: 0.01 (Excellent)
  - Attack delay: 0.42 ms
  - Detection modes functional

### 6. DimensionExpander
- **Status**: FUNCTIONAL WITH ISSUES
- **Quality Score**: 0.00/100 (Grade: D)  
- **THD**: 20.87%
- **Key Findings**:
  - Width parameter has most significant effect
  - Other spatial parameters show incremental changes
  - Attack delay: 0.62 ms
  - Mix parameter functional

## Common Issues Identified

1. **Low Quality Scores**: All engines scored below 65/100
2. **High THD**: Most engines show 15-30% harmonic distortion
3. **Parameter Sensitivity**: Many parameters show minimal audible effect
4. **Gain Staging**: Several engines have incorrect gain compensation

## Recommendations

### Critical Fixes Needed:
1. **VintageOptoCompressor**: Reduce excessive compression and distortion
2. **NoiseGate**: Fix non-responsive parameters (Range, Attack, Hold, Release)
3. **MasteringLimiter**: Correct gain reduction curves and ceiling behavior

### General Improvements:
1. Implement proper gain compensation across all dynamics engines
2. Reduce harmonic distortion to < 5% for transparent processing
3. Increase parameter sensitivity and useful range
4. Add visual metering for gain reduction feedback

## Comparison with Reverb Engines
Unlike the reverb engines which required architectural fixes, the dynamics engines primarily need parameter tuning and gain staging corrections. The core DSP appears functional but requires calibration.

## Test Coverage
✅ ClassicCompressor - Tested  
✅ VintageOptoCompressor - Tested  
✅ NoiseGate - Tested  
✅ MasteringLimiter_Platinum - Tested  
✅ TransientShaper_Platinum - Tested  
✅ DimensionExpander - Tested  

## Conclusion
All 6 dynamics/compression engines have been successfully tested. While functional, they require significant parameter tuning and gain staging improvements to meet professional audio standards. The low quality scores indicate these engines need optimization similar to what was done for the reverb engines.
