# Ambience Primitive DSP Rebuild Report
## Specialist Team Analysis and Implementation

### Executive Summary
A complete rebuild of the Chimera Phoenix reverb engines was executed by a specialist DSP team to address critical failures in the original implementations. Three professional-grade reverb engines have been designed and implemented from scratch using authoritative DSP algorithms.

## 1. SPRING REVERB ENGINE

### DSP Research Scientist Analysis

**Problem Identified:**
- Original implementation exhibited "tinny twang" with infinite repetition
- Incorrect allpass filter implementation causing simple echoes instead of dispersion
- Feedback accumulation bug in buffer management

**Correct Algorithm Specification:**
Spring reverb requires frequency-dependent dispersion where high frequencies travel faster than low frequencies through the spring medium. This is achieved through:
- Cascaded allpass filters with frequency-dependent coefficients
- Chirp generator for transient "boing" response
- Dispersive delay line with modulation
- Proper damping to simulate mechanical losses

**DSP Architecture:**
```
Input → Chirp Generator → Allpass Cascade 1 (4 stages) → Dispersive Delay → 
        Allpass Cascade 2 (3 stages) → Damping Filter → Feedback Path → Output
```

### Implementation Details

**Key Components:**
1. **StableAllpass Class**: Implements proper allpass equation `y[n] = -g*x[n] + x[n-D] + g*y[n-D]`
2. **ChirpGenerator**: Detects transients and generates 100Hz-2kHz sweep
3. **Dispersive Delay**: Frequency-dependent delay modulation
4. **Feedback Limiting**: Maximum 0.65 coefficient for guaranteed stability

### Expected Sonic Character
The SpringReverb produces a characteristic metallic "sproing" on transients, followed by a bright, dispersive decay. The tension parameter controls spring tightness from loose/wobbly to tight/zingy. Complex harmonics and non-linear behavior create authentic spring tank emulation.

## 2. SHIMMER REVERB ENGINE

### DSP Research Scientist Analysis

**Problem Identified:**
- Massive feedback explosion due to pitch shifter in main feedback loop
- Loop gain exceeding unity causing instant oscillation
- No isolation between reverb core and pitch shifting

**Correct Algorithm Specification:**
Shimmer reverb requires parallel architecture with isolated pitch shifting:
- Main hall reverb processes normally
- Reverb output is tapped (not fed back) to pitch shifter
- Pitch-shifted signal mixed at INPUT, not in feedback loop
- Total loop gain must never exceed 0.9

**DSP Architecture:**
```
Input → [+] → Hall Reverb Core → Output
         ↑         ↓(tap)
         ↑         ↓
         ← Gain ← PitchShift(+12)
      (shimmer_mix * 0.5)
```

### Implementation Details

**Key Components:**
1. **HallReverbCore**: Schroeder architecture with 4 combs + 2 allpass filters
2. **SMBPitchShiftFixed Integration**: Phase vocoder pitch shifting
3. **Parallel Feedback Path**: Isolated shimmer buffer preventing explosion
4. **Highpass Filter**: 200Hz HP on pitched signal removes muddiness

**Stability Measures:**
- Shimmer feedback scaled by 0.5 for stability
- Soft limiting with tanh() prevents clipping
- Maximum reverb feedback limited to 0.85

### Expected Sonic Character
The ShimmerReverb creates an ethereal, angelic atmosphere with octave-shifted harmonics blooming above the main reverb tail. The parallel architecture allows sustained shimmer effects without feedback explosion. Ideal for ambient pads, cinematic swells, and dream-like textures.

## 3. GATED REVERB ENGINE

### DSP Research Scientist Analysis

**Problem Identified:**
- Original implementation was gating the input signal, not the reverb tail
- No reverb processing was occurring - just silence
- Complete misunderstanding of the gated reverb effect

**Correct Algorithm Specification:**
Gated reverb is a specific 1980s production technique where:
- Large, bright reverb processes the signal
- Envelope follower tracks the DRY input amplitude
- Gate closes on WET reverb tail when input drops below threshold
- Hold and release times create the characteristic abrupt cutoff

**DSP Architecture:**
```
Input → [Split] → Envelope Follower → Gate Control
           ↓                              ↓
      Large Reverb → [×] Gate Multiplier ← Gate Envelope
                       ↓
                    Output
```

### Implementation Details

**Key Components:**
1. **GatedReverbCore**: 6 comb + 3 allpass for dense reverb
2. **EnvelopeFollower**: Tracks input signal amplitude
3. **NoiseGate State Machine**: CLOSED→OPENING→OPEN→HOLDING→CLOSING
4. **Hysteresis**: 90% threshold for gate reopening prevents chatter

**Gate Parameters:**
- **Threshold**: Sensitivity of gate trigger
- **Hold Time**: Duration gate stays open after signal drops
- **Release Time**: Speed of gate closing (key to effect)
- **Room Size**: Controls reverb decay time

### Expected Sonic Character
The GatedReverb produces the iconic 80s drum sound - a massive, explosive reverb that abruptly cuts off. The bright, dense reverb tail is dramatically truncated by the gate, creating the "boom-stop" effect made famous by Phil Collins and Prince. Adjusting the release time changes from subtle gating to extreme choppy effects.

## 4. HALL REVERB ENGINE (Additional)

### DSP Research Scientist Analysis

**Problem Identified:**
- Original GatedReverb was gating input, not output
- No actual reverb processing occurring
- Misunderstanding of gated reverb concept

**Correct Algorithm Specification:**
Hall reverb is the foundation - a rich algorithmic reverb that can achieve gated effects through parameter control:
- 8 parallel comb filters for density
- 4 series allpass filters for diffusion
- Early reflections for spatial definition
- Modulated delays for chorusing effect

**DSP Architecture:**
```
Input → Early Reflections → [8 Parallel Comb Filters] → [4 Series Allpass] → Output
                                  ↑                           ↓
                                  ← Feedback (0.5-0.98) ←
```

### Implementation Details

**Key Components:**
1. **ModulatedCombFilter**: Comb with LFO modulation for richness
2. **EarlyReflections**: 8 taps with decreasing gains
3. **Prime Number Delays**: Prevents coloration from harmonic buildup
4. **Stereo Processing**: Independent L/R paths with width control

**Gated Effect Achievement:**
- High damping (0.9) creates rapid HF decay
- Large room size with short decay mimics gated sound
- Early reflections emphasis provides initial burst

### Expected Sonic Character
The HallReverb creates expansive, concert hall spaces with smooth, natural decay. Modulated comb filters add subtle chorusing for lushness. By adjusting parameters, users can achieve everything from small rooms to cathedral spaces, including the classic 80s gated drum sound through extreme damping settings.
