## Current State Summary
- **57 DSP Engines** implemented across 9 categories
- **78.9% Pass Rate** in comprehensive validation (12 engines need fixes)
- **Strong Architecture** with EngineArchitectureManager central authority
- **Professional Testing** infrastructure in place
- **119 Files Modified** in recent overhaul with 17,476 insertions

## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### ðŸ”´ Priority 1: Engine Stability (Week 1)
**12 Engines Failing Validation**
