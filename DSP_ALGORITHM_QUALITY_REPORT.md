---

## 5. Numerical Stability

### 5.1 Denormal Protection
**Quality Rating: 10/10 - Exceptional**

**Implementation Quality:**
The codebase demonstrates **industry-leading** denormal protection with multiple layers:

**Layer 1: RAII CPU Flags (DenormalGuard)**
```cpp
DenormalGuard guard; // Sets FTZ/DAZ modes
// - Flush-to-Zero (FTZ) on output
// - Denormals-Are-Zero (DAZ) on input
// - SSE intrinsics (_mm_setcsr)
// - Automatic restoration on scope exit
```

**Layer 2: Scalar Flushing (DSPUtils::flushDenorm)**
```cpp
template<typename T>
inline T flushDenorm(T x) noexcept {
    constexpr T tiny = (T)1.0e-30;
    return std::abs(x) < tiny ? (T)0 : x;
}
```

**Layer 3: SIMD Buffer Flushing**
- SSE-optimized buffer processing
- 4-sample parallel comparison
- Blend with zero using _mm_blendv_ps

**Usage Patterns:**
- Used in LadderFilter, StateVariableFilter, FeedbackNetwork, BucketBrigadeDelay
- Applied after state updates in filters
- Used in circular buffers and delay lines

**This is textbook-perfect denormal protection.**

---

### 5.2 Feedback Stability
**Quality Rating: 8.5/10 - Professional**

**LadderFilter Stability Measures:**
1. **Dynamic k-limiting:** `maxK = 4.0f * (1.0f - g) / (1.0f + g)`
2. **Safety margin:** `k = clamp(k, 0.0f, maxK * 0.95f)`
3. **Division-by-zero protection:** Checks `|1.0f + g| < 1e-6f`
4. **Coefficient clamping:** `g = clamp(g, -0.99f, 0.98f)`

**FeedbackNetwork Stability:**
1. **Feedback limiting:** Hard clamp at ±0.85 (safe margin)
2. **Crossfeed limiting:** Same ±0.85 range
3. **Modulation clamping:** Depth limited to 0.05 (5%)
4. **Bounds checking:** Before buffer access

**PlateReverb (Freeverb-based) Stability:**
1. **Proven algorithm:** Freeverb is battle-tested since 2000
2. **Fixed feedback coefficients:** Based on empirical tuning
3. **Damping integration:** One-pole lowpass in feedback path
4. **No instability possible** with proper room size (<1.0)

**Excellent stability throughout codebase.**

---

### 5.3 NaN/Inf Protection
**Quality Rating: 9.0/10 - Excellent**

**Implementation:**
```cpp
inline void scrubBuffer(juce::AudioBuffer<float>& buf) noexcept {
    for (int ch = 0; ch < buf.getNumChannels(); ++ch) {
        auto* data = buf.getWritePointer(ch);
        for (int i = 0; i < buf.getNumSamples(); ++i) {
            const float v = data[i];
            data[i] = std::isfinite(v) ? v : 0.0f;
        }
    }
}
```

**Usage:**
- Called at end of process() in most engines
- Prevents NaN propagation between plugin chains
- Zero-cost in normal operation (modern CPUs have fast isfinite)

**Additional Safety:**
```cpp
template<typename T>
inline T clampSafe(T x, T minVal, T maxVal) noexcept {
    x = std::isfinite(x) ? x : (T)0;
    return std::max(minVal, std::min(maxVal, x));
}
```

Used extensively for parameter validation.

## 6. Parameter Smoothing Quality
**Quality Rating: 9.0/10 - Excellent**

**Implementation:**
- **Exponential smoothing** (one-pole IIR)
- **Sample-rate aware** with proper time constant calculation
- **Configurable speeds** (Instant, Fast 3ms, Medium 15ms, Slow 75ms)
- **Denormal-flushed** state updates
- **Atomic parameters** for lock-free updates

**Algorithm:**
```
y[n] = a * y[n-1] + (1-a) * x[n]
where a = exp(-1 / (timeMs * 0.001 * sampleRate))
```

This is the **standard professional approach** - no improvements needed.

    float c0 = x0;
    float c1 = 0.5f * (x1 - x_1);
    float c2 = x_1 - 2.5f * x0 + 2.0f * x1 - 0.5f * x2;
    float c3 = 0.5f * (x2 - x_1) + 1.5f * (x0 - x1);
    return ((c3 * frac + c2) * frac + c1) * frac + c0;
}

    double sustain = m_sustain->process();
    bool needsOversampling = (sustain > 0.7);  // High gain threshold

    if (needsOversampling) {
        // Oversample at 2x for high gain
        for (int ch = 0; ch < numChannels; ++ch) {
            m_oversamplers[ch].processUp(inputData);
            // Process at 2x rate
            m_oversamplers[ch].processDown(outputData);
        }

        // Read from delays
        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; ++i) {
            buffer[i] = delays[i];
        }

        // Apply Hadamard transform (8x8)
        hadamard8(buffer.data());

        // Scale and write back
        float scale = 1.0f / std::sqrt(SIZE);
        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; ++i) {
            delays[i] = buffer[i] * scale;
