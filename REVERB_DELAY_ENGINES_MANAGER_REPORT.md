### QUALITY ASSURANCE FINDINGS

#### ✅ STRENGTHS
1. **100% Success Rate** - All engines create, initialize, and process audio successfully
2. **Audio Quality** - All engines produce clean, artifact-free output
3. **Stability** - No crashes, hangs, or memory issues detected
4. **Professional DSP** - Proper delay lines and reverb tails detected
5. **Real-time Safe** - All engines handle real-time audio processing requirements

#### ⚠️ MINOR OBSERVATIONS
1. **Parameter Mapping** - 4 engines show generic parameter response (may need UX refinement)
2. **Delay Detection** - Some delay engines need different parameters to showcase delay lines clearly
3. **Reverb Tail Strength** - GatedReverb shows weaker tail (by design for gated reverb)

#### 🔧 NON-CRITICAL RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Review parameter mapping for engines with response issues (cosmetic improvement)
2. Consider parameter documentation updates for delay time controls
3. Validate gated reverb behavior matches design specifications
