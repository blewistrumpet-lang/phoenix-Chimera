# Phoenix Plugin Build & Test Results

## Build Status ‚úÖ
- **Standalone Plugin**: Successfully built 
- **Audio Unit (AU)**: Successfully built
- Both versions compiled with voice input support

## Testing Results

### 1. Standalone Application ‚úÖ
- Application launches successfully
- Trinity AI text box visible with glow effects  
- Voice button (microphone icon) added next to text box

### 2. Logic Pro Integration ‚úÖ
- Audio Unit installed to `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/`
- Plugin loads in Logic Pro
- All 57 DSP engines accessible

### 3. Trinity Server Connection ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Issue Found**: Server requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` to be set
- Server health check returns healthy when key is set
- Auto-start feature implemented but needs API key in environment

### 4. Voice Input Feature üî¥
**Critical Issue**: Standalone crashes when clicking microphone button
- Likely audio device initialization issue
- Transcription endpoint exists but needs testing with API key

## Issues to Address

1. **OpenAI API Key Requirement**
   - Server won't start without `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
   - Need to export: `export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key'`

2. **Microphone Button Crash**
   - Clicking voice button causes standalone to crash
   - Probable cause: Audio device manager not properly initialized
   - May need to request microphone permissions on macOS

3. **Python Command**
   - Fixed: Changed from `python` to `python3` in scripts
   - Server now uses `python3` consistently

## Next Steps

1. Set OpenAI API key in environment
2. Debug microphone crash issue
3. Test voice transcription with proper API credentials
4. Verify AU validation with proper component info

## File Updates Made

- Added `AIServerManager.cpp/h` for auto-starting server
- Added `VoiceRecordButton.cpp/h` for voice input
- Updated `PluginEditorNexusStatic` to include voice button
- Modified `TrinityTextBox` to add `getTextEditor()` accessor
- Updated `.jucer` project file with new source files
- Fixed `start_trinity.sh` to use `python3`

## Architecture Confirmation

‚úÖ TRUE Trinity Pipeline implemented:
- **Visionary**: AI preset generation (OpenAI)
- **Calculator**: AI optimization (OpenAI) 
- **Alchemist**: Local safety validation

‚ùå Removed components:
- Oracle (corpus matching removed)
- Golden Corpus database
- FAISS indexing
- Preset matching
